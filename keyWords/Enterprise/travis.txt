TRAVIS: I heard this platform's been approved for bio-transport.#
TRAVIS: I mean Armoury Officers and Helmsmen.#
TRAVIS: They claim it's safe.#
TRAVIS: Don't worry, from what I'm told, he wouldn't even put his dog through this thing.#
TRAVIS: We're just taking a sick man back to his homeworld. Why do we need weapons?#
TRAVIS: Is it me, or does the artificial gravity seem a bit heavy?#
TRAVIS: My father always kept it at point eight G. He thought it put a little spring in his step.#
TRAVIS: How fast have you gotten her?#
TRAVIS: Four point five.#
TRAVIS: Course laid in, sir. Request permission to get underway.#
TRAVIS:  Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: When I was a kid, we called it the sweet spot. Every ship's got one.#
TRAVIS: It's usually about halfway between the grav-generator and the bow plate. Grab a hold of the hatch. No, on either side. Now push off. Push off.#
TRAVIS: It takes practice. Ever slept in zero G?#
TRAVIS: It's just like being back in the womb.#
TRAVIS: It took the fourth, fifth and sixth grades to get there. I've also been to Draylax and both the Denebian moons.#
TRAVIS: Three. It's true.#
TRAVIS: First-hand, second-hand, third-hand.#
TRAVIS: Warp four point three, sir.#
TRAVIS: We're losing power on all decks.#
TRAVIS: Mister Reed thought he detected something right before we lost power.#
TRAVIS: Is this where you saw Klaang?#
TRAVIS: We should get going.#
TRAVIS: Sir.#
TRAVIS: You don't know anything about Klaang, do you.#
TRAVIS: Lieutenant, this man has no intention of helping us.#
TRAVIS:  I can't believe we fell for that.#
TRAVIS: Ask him where they are. This storm's getting worse.#
TRAVIS: The storm's kicking up too much interference. I can't isolate human biosigns. They could be anywhere in the complex.#
TRAVIS:  I found her.#
TRAVIS: The starboard thruster's down!#
TRAVIS: They're getting too far ahead of us.#
TRAVIS: I'm not authorised to go beyond four four.#
TRAVIS: I'm okay, Captain#
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up something at three forty two mark twelve. It's a lot bigger.#
TRAVIS: All right. What's this?#
TRAVIS: No, that's the pitch control. This is the guidance system.#
TRAVIS: The docking interface. How do you deploy it?#
TRAVIS: Good. Where's the auxiliary throttle?#
TRAVIS: With all due respect to Commander Tucker, I'm pretty sure I could fly this thing, sir.#
TRAVIS: That one was a lot closer.#
TRAVIS: In what direction?#
TRAVIS: At this rate, the Captain'll never find us.#
TRAVIS: Laid in.#
TRAVIS: Two kilometres, dead ahead.#
TRAVIS: These aren't ideal conditions.#
TRAVIS: I'm reading an ion storm on that trajectory, sir. Should I go around it?#
TRAVIS: Fore and aft target scanners are aligned.#
TRAVIS: Simulated launch.#
TRAVIS: We're only off by three metres.#
TRAVIS: We'll get it right.#
TRAVIS: Not yet.#
TRAVIS: I hope you don't expect everyone we run into out here to be hostile. In twenty three years I don't think my folks ran into a problem more than a half dozen times.#
TRAVIS: Do you think that makes a difference?#
TRAVIS: Seems like everybody else on board is itching for a first contact.#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. We made a trip once from Livinius to Belarn Prime. Two and a half light years. Nearly nine months without running into a soul. There were five kids on board. We were at each others throats within a matter of weeks. First officer and my mother came up with the idea to teach us how to play geography. You know, you say Amazon River, which ends in an R. I say Rhode Island.#
TRAVIS: X, X.#
TRAVIS: Don't tell me, I know an X. Xanadu.#
TRAVIS: Doesn't matter.#
TRAVIS: Well, you used an alien planet, Dralax.#
TRAVIS: Point five microns.#
TRAVIS: Range, five thousand kilometres.#
TRAVIS: Are those venting ports or hull breaches?#
TRAVIS: Maybe they're in trouble. Sick or something.#
TRAVIS: Mayweather here, sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: We've reversed course, sir. We should be back at the coordinates in five hours.#
TRAVIS: Distance, sixty thousand kilometres.#
TRAVIS: The pod's on the arm.#
TRAVIS: We're dead in the water, sir.#
TRAVIS: What was that?#
TRAVIS: Sir, another vessel just dropped out of warp.#
TRAVIS: They're on an intercept course.#
TRAVIS: I can't, sir. Their beam's disrupting all our propulsion systems.#
TRAVIS: We've got impulse back.#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: Minshara-class?#
TRAVIS: Aye sir.#
TRAVIS: It's beautiful all right, but I couldn't call a place home unless it came with a pair of warp nacelles.#
TRAVIS: We would?#
TRAVIS: Keep in mind those cargo vessels weren't equipped for rescue operations, so the Captain wasn't sure what to do when he picked up the distress call. But it wasn't a ship that sent the signal. It was a life-pod from one of the old Y-500-class freighters.#
TRAVIS: Exactly. The pod had been drifting in space for sixty three years. Bioscans showed one lifesign inside the pod. Human. The assistant engineer, George Webb, a friend of my uncle's, was assigned to open it. Took him over an hour to cut through the hull. He said the metal felt strange, cold to the touch.#
TRAVIS: He could hear a tapping noise coming from inside, but when he finally got it open the pod was empty. No body, nothing. A few days later, Webb started acting strange, getting into fights with the crew, muttering to himself in some sort of alien language. Then one day he locked himself in Engineering and overloaded the impulse reactors. He almost destroyed the ship. Then he sealed himself in a life pod and ejected it.#
TRAVIS: The reactors were too badly damaged. Some people say it was an alien life form that got into him, others think it was the ghost of a dead crewman. I never knew what to believe, but Webb is still out there, drifting. When the subspace noise is real low, some comm. officers say they can still hear the echo of his distress call. Beep, Beep.#
TRAVIS: Are you sure?#
TRAVIS: Now you know.#
TRAVIS: It must be gusting at eighty kph.#
TRAVIS: Try flying through an ion storm at warp two.#
TRAVIS: What is it?#
TRAVIS: What for?#
TRAVIS: Are we allowed to squash alien life forms?#
TRAVIS: You wanna shoot a bug?#
TRAVIS: Not me, sir.#
TRAVIS: I'll go.#
TRAVIS: Trip? Hello?#
TRAVIS: Was anybody outside just now?#
TRAVIS: There's someone else out there.#
TRAVIS: Near the campsite.#
TRAVIS: It's no story.#
TRAVIS: I'm telling you, I saw three people.#
TRAVIS: It was too dark.#
TRAVIS: There could be something wrong with your scanner.#
TRAVIS: They looked pretty real to me.#
TRAVIS: Ethan!#
TRAVIS:  Ethan!#
TRAVIS: That could explain why they're not showing up on our scanners.#
TRAVIS: The Captain's on his way. We're getting out of here.#
TRAVIS: You okay?#
TRAVIS: Sir. I hate to add to our problems, but we're running low on water.#
TRAVIS: Sir?#
TRAVIS: You were the one who found these caves, and it was your idea to stay overnight.#
TRAVIS: Commander! There!#
TRAVIS: I'm trying, sir.#
TRAVIS: No.#
TRAVIS: I was hoping it was all just a bad dream.#
TRAVIS: Ow, I must have twisted up my neck. How's Novakovich? Do we know?#
TRAVIS: Going to impulse, sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: We've got a seal.#
TRAVIS: It's too bad the ship-to-ship sensors are down. Would have been nice to get a look at them.#
TRAVIS:  Here you go.#
TRAVIS: I don't know. We are kind of busy. Have fun.#
TRAVIS: Before you know it, he'll have that engine room running like a well-oiled machine.#
TRAVIS: Decompression any easier coming back?#
TRAVIS: What were the Xyrillians like?#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Looks like their signature.#
TRAVIS: Should I lay in a new course, Captain?#
TRAVIS: This was their first view of it.#
TRAVIS: Breaking ground on the town hall.#
TRAVIS: No, I think that's Mitchell.#
TRAVIS: Three hours seventeen minutes to go, sir.#
TRAVIS: There's tons of data here. Crew manifests, survey photos, weekly status reports. I was hoping to find something, a clue to what happened.#
TRAVIS: I've been fascinated by Terra Nova since I was a kid, sir. I always thought lost colonies affected boomers more than anyone else. Something about people who choose to live off-world.#
TRAVIS: Two hundred thousand kilometres.#
TRAVIS: I promised my dad I'd see this place someday.#
TRAVIS: A housing unit.#
TRAVIS: We've got the schematics for the communications tower.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Where's Malcolm?#
TRAVIS: If those aliens killed the colonists, they could kill Malcolm too.#
TRAVIS: I don't get it. If they're human, why were they shooting at us?#
TRAVIS: Can we use the transporter?#
TRAVIS: They didn't seem too eager to talk.#
TRAVIS: It's Captain Mitchell.#
TRAVIS: Mark Logan was the head of the opposition, the ones who were against a second wave of settlers. Supposedly, he threatened to fire at any ship that came into orbit.#
TRAVIS: We don't. We only want to help you, make you healthy.#
TRAVIS: I've got the landing site locked in, Captain.#
TRAVIS: Our thrusters are down.;#
TRAVIS: Pod One to Enterprise, we've got an emergency.#
TRAVIS: Ever heard of Judge Crater?#
TRAVIS: Disappeared in the early twentieth century. How about Amelia Earhart?#
TRAVIS:#
TRAVIS: All these years wondering about that colony. I never thought I'd become part of their history.#
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.#
TRAVIS: There what is?#
TRAVIS: Not a lot of room on that landing platform. Maybe they're just some other visitors.#
TRAVIS: You heard what he said. If we try to send more people.#
TRAVIS: Sir, you're wearing a hole in the deck plating.#
TRAVIS: Archer's comet.#
TRAVIS: Aye sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: The comet's certainly big enough to land on. We could take a shuttlepod.#
TRAVIS: Has anyone?#
TRAVIS: I've only seen snow twice in my life.#
TRAVIS: You mean plant a flag?#
TRAVIS: Snowball fight.#
TRAVIS: Lieutenant.#
TRAVIS: What do you think?#
TRAVIS: The ears are a nice touch.#
TRAVIS: We should get out more often.#
TRAVIS: Impressive.#
TRAVIS: I'll get the drill.#
TRAVIS: I'm okay. Ah!#
TRAVIS: My knee.#
TRAVIS: I'm all right.#
TRAVIS: At least take the core sample. We shouldn't go back to the ship empty-handed.#
TRAVIS: It might be faster without the suits.#
TRAVIS: I hope I never see snow again.#
TRAVIS: We should have never ignited the thrusters.#
TRAVIS: They've got us.#
TRAVIS: Should we hail them?#
TRAVIS: There's a ship approaching.#
TRAVIS: It must have been in a geosynchonous orbit on the other side of the planet.#
TRAVIS: I'll try.#
TRAVIS: We've lost lateral thrusters.#
TRAVIS: I can't shake them.#
TRAVIS: Not counting newborn babies.#
TRAVIS: I grew up on a J-class, a little smaller but the same basic design, and one thing I can tell you is that at warp one point eight you've got a lot of time on your hands between ports. That's how my parents wound up with me.#
TRAVIS: Well, typically nothing more than a low-yield plasma cannon, but most freight haulers would've upgraded the first chance they got.#
TRAVIS: Think about it. You're a dozen light years from home with twenty kilotons of dilithium ore in your hold, armed with nothing but a pop-gun for shooting oncoming meteors. What would you do?#
TRAVIS: Aye sir.#
TRAVIS: There should be an auxiliary hatch on the port side.#
TRAVIS: Pirates, sir. They've been attacking freighters in this sector for years. My parents had a run-in with them once. They were lucky to come out of it alive.#
TRAVIS: Still do. An old J-class, the Horizon.#
TRAVIS: He's got a lot more experience than any freighter medic I know.#
TRAVIS: Trip'll get a kick out of this, it's older than he is. The Quartermaster won't have anything like it but Engineering should be able to make one for you.#
TRAVIS: I'm sure your guys have their hands full. We're happy to do it.#
TRAVIS: Enterprise came with all the trimmings.#
TRAVIS: Not yet. Most of the crew is afraid, but I'm kind of curious to try it out.#
TRAVIS: Why do you think I want to try it.#
TRAVIS: I was born on her, halfway between Draylax and Vega Colony.#
TRAVIS: I've still got my sister and her husband aboard the Horizon, but I know my dad expected me to take over at some point.#
TRAVIS: I had to figure out where I wanted to spend the rest of my life, and I was pretty sure it wasn't on the Draylax - Vega run. Besides, the Horizon didn't have transporters to play with.#
TRAVIS: Even with a warp three engine you'd be able to cut a five year cargo run down to six months.#
TRAVIS: Save room for dessert, home made ice-cream.#
TRAVIS: Chef's the best in Starfleet. I heard the Captain had to call in a lot of favours to get him on board. It's good you stayed away from the resequenced meat loaf. They still haven't gotten that right.#
TRAVIS: That's because it is.#
TRAVIS: I remember those. What did we used to call them?#
TRAVIS: My dad was a pretty good cook. He could do magical things with those nutri-paks.#
TRAVIS: Didn't stop you from eating it.#
TRAVIS: Your parents on the Fortunate?#
TRAVIS: Were you on board?#
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.#
TRAVIS: You ever think about doing something else?#
TRAVIS: The food's not bad.#
TRAVIS: No, but you've spent more time in space than most Starfleet Captains. There are three more NX class ships on the drawing boards. They're going to need experienced people.#
TRAVIS: Don't worry, not everybody's going to go.#
TRAVIS: You think leaving the Horizon was easy for me? That I just took off because I got tired of the food? That ship was my home.#
TRAVIS: Being in Starfleet is the best thing that ever happened to me. My parents weren't happy I left, but they respected my decision.#
TRAVIS: They're charging weapons.#
TRAVIS: They're jettisoning our pod. Their warp drive's coming online.#
TRAVIS: We don't know where they are, but we know who they're looking for. The Nausicaans. Ryan's after revenge, sir.#
TRAVIS: It's rational to him. Those pirates attacked his ship. That's his family. If we want to find the Fortunate, we need to find the Nausicaans.#
TRAVIS: No. Try bypassing circuit L-47.#
TRAVIS: Never thought I'd see a Y-class running from any ship I was on. When I was growing up on the Horizon, anything that happened on board you handles yourself. If someone on the crew got into a fight, you just worked it out. You took care of your own. If Starfleet suddenly showed up and told my father what he could and couldn't do on his own ship?#
TRAVIS: Maybe he already has and he just doesn't like it.#
TRAVIS: Do you have a minute, sir?#
TRAVIS: Permission to speak freely, sir?#
TRAVIS: I'm worried that we're not handling the situation the right way.#
TRAVIS: You know I'd never question your orders.#
TRAVIS: Maybe Ryan's right. Maybe this isn't any of our business. If he doesn't want our help, why force it on him.#
TRAVIS: Don't underestimate a freighter crew, sir. My father never ran into any trouble he couldn't handle himself, Nausicaans included.#
TRAVIS: Sir?#
TRAVIS: He'd probably try to blow them out of the sky.#
TRAVIS: You're right, sir. I suppose I should understand that more than anyone.#
TRAVIS: Not today, sir. Thank you, sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: He wouldn't be there if you hadn't attacked them in the first place.#
TRAVIS: What are you going to do, kill him?#
TRAVIS: Sir, with your permission. You think killing one of them is going to accomplish anything?#
TRAVIS: I'm just thinking about my family.#
TRAVIS: What's going to happen to the next freighter that runs into the Nausicaans? What if it's the Horizon and they have to pay the price for your#
TRAVIS: The hell you are! This isn't about protecting cargo ships.#
TRAVIS: Don't kid yourself into thinking you're doing this for some greater good. This is about revenge, nothing else.#
TRAVIS: You don't like me because I left the Horizon to join Starfleet. You're afraid that if more people do that there won't be anyone left to run the freighters. Maybe you're right#
TRAVIS: The Nausicaans are going to kill you and your crew.#
TRAVIS: And then there'll be twenty three fewer people out there to run those freighters.#
TRAVIS: Hold the door. Where were you last night?#
TRAVIS: Well, you didn't miss much.#
TRAVIS: Night of the Killer Androids.#
TRAVIS: We've got fifty thousand movies in the database. There must be something worth watching.#
TRAVIS: Lieutenant.#
TRAVIS: We found one of the ships, sir.#
TRAVIS: Did you get to meet them?#
TRAVIS: Looks like the Captain's going all out.#
TRAVIS: What?#
TRAVIS: I'm fine right here.#
TRAVIS: I can wait till I'm promoted.#
TRAVIS: Nice fit.;Bridge looks a lot different from here. Think anyone would mind if I fired a torpedo?#
TRAVIS: Sorry, sir.#
TRAVIS: He's probably calling about the weather.#
TRAVIS: I'm already on it.#
TRAVIS: The storm's moving in our direction. I'm having trouble getting around it.#
TRAVIS: He's far enough ahead. He made it past.#
TRAVIS: There's a vessel approaching no bigger than a shuttlepod. It's Suliban.#
TRAVIS: Maybe they checked us out and decided we weren't very interesting.#
TRAVIS: I had to reverse engines to keep from banging into them.#
TRAVIS: They've gone to warp, sir.#
TRAVIS: So how's your secret mission coming?#
TRAVIS: Sir, we could try to contact the Vulcan High Command. They're only two days away at warp six. I'm sure they'd give us a hand.#
TRAVIS: Should I try evasive manoeuvres?#
TRAVIS: Ten thousand metres, nine.#
TRAVIS: Five thousand metres.#
TRAVIS: One thousand metres.#
TRAVIS: Gladly, sir.#
TRAVIS: Nothing I can't avoid, sir.#
TRAVIS: It might be easier to locate the shuttlepod.#
TRAVIS: At least it sounds like they're still alive.#
TRAVIS: Here we go.#
TRAVIS: Siren calls. That's what we called them when I was a kid. My dad would put them through the speakers whenever we flew by a gas giant. It gave me nightmares sometimes.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS:  Captain.#
TRAVIS: Sir, they're heading into open space.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: Ten thousand metres, but I'm having a hard time getting a fix on them. Too much interference.#
TRAVIS: Sir, external pressure's at maximum.#
TRAVIS: The hull plating's failing.#
TRAVIS: I found these schematics in the Vulcan database. It's a Raptor Class scout vessel.#
TRAVIS: Its hull's at least twice as thick as ours, reinforced with some kind of coherent molecular alloy.#
TRAVIS: Our only other option is for T'Pol and Malcolm to fix a broken-down Klingon ship and fly it out themselves.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Sir, there are two ships approaching at high warp. I think they're Klingon.#
TRAVIS: Sixteen minutes. We're being hailed. It's the Captain.#
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain. It's the Raptor, sir. They're hailing us.#
TRAVIS: They're moving off.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: It's big. Over eight billion kilometres in diameter.#
TRAVIS: According to sensors.#
TRAVIS: It's a real honour, sir. Seeing those Starfleet captains every day gave us something to aspire to.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Shouldn't the surface be frozen solid?#
TRAVIS: Are we sure that's a good idea?#
TRAVIS: We don't know what happened to the crew. That ship could be a tomb. You really think we should be picking through it for spare parts, sir?#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. I was just wondering. If that trader left in such a hurry, why'd he bother to close the hatch behind him?#
TRAVIS: What do you think that trader really saw down here, sir?#
TRAVIS: That makes sense, except scavengers would've stripped this ship to the keel.#
TRAVIS: Would make a good one, sir.#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. There's no power but the data modules look intact.#
TRAVIS: Didn't you send out a distress call?#
TRAVIS: Well, we can't just leave you here.#
TRAVIS: It's not big enough to feed all the people on that ship, sir. Not by a long shot.#
TRAVIS: It's in shuttlepod one.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Won't they pick us up on sensors?#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain? Sir?#
TRAVIS: I saw at least thirty. This place is pretty big. There could be more.#
TRAVIS: I didn't exactly have time to get a good look.#
TRAVIS: There's a wall about five metres high. It's looks like it surrounds this entire building. I see something that might be a guard tower but I can't be sure.#
TRAVIS: No, sir.#
TRAVIS: And you are?#
TRAVIS: Does everyone that violates your territory get thrown into a place like this?#
TRAVIS: If you're worried we're Suliban, trust me, we're not.#
TRAVIS: Three days?#
TRAVIS: They call this a proper meal? I should save it for Commander Tucker. It'd make a good valve sealant.#
TRAVIS:  This thing doesn't hold much.#
TRAVIS: I've had plenty, thank you. It was very good.#
TRAVIS: What about the government on the Suliban homeworld? Don't they have something to say about this?#
TRAVIS: Writing a letter?#
TRAVIS: Could be valuable someday. People will want to know what happened here.#
TRAVIS: Then why are you writing it?#
TRAVIS: That's not true.#
TRAVIS: Would you rather spend the rest of your life in prison?#
TRAVIS: Sorry, Captain.#
TRAVIS: What do you care.#
TRAVIS: You might try isolation. Still think we're working with the Tandarans? You know, we could have left this place a long time ago if we hadn't decided to help you.#
TRAVIS: Why? Because we're not Suliban? Because we look a little too much like Tandarans? I'll admit, when I first came here it wasn't easy to see past my preconceptions about the Suliban, but I did. Why can't you?#
TRAVIS: Yes?#
TRAVIS: Who are you?#
TRAVIS: Malcolm?#
TRAVIS: Long story. How'd you get down here?#
TRAVIS: Are you sure you weren't detected?#
TRAVIS: They're in place. Are you up for this?#
TRAVIS: Good luck.#
TRAVIS: Major, do you have a second? I don't mean to cause any trouble, but I was wondering if it might be possible to get some better food. No offence, but the meals here are pretty awful.#
TRAVIS: I'll try, but I'm not sure I can hold down another bowl of that what do you call it? It tastes like sawdust. Is that what they make you eat? Because if it is, I'd think about going on a hunger strike. I don't know how you.#
TRAVIS: I'll go.#
TRAVIS: Come on.#
TRAVIS: Captain, think they'll make it?#
TRAVIS: What, the static?#
TRAVIS: You've got better ears than we do.#
TRAVIS: How's the translation coming along?#
TRAVIS: What about it?#
TRAVIS: I can see how that might cause some confusion over dinner.#
TRAVIS: What if they just don't like being touched? Remember how uncomfortable they looked when the Captain tried to shake their hands?#
TRAVIS: Are you staying for the movie tonight?#
TRAVIS:#
TRAVIS: Two hours and twenty four minutes.#
TRAVIS: You'll be on the edge of your seat.#
TRAVIS: Don't worry.#
TRAVIS: The last time we opened the airlock, we were docked with the Kreetassans.#
TRAVIS: The Kreetassans might know something about this thing. I can start scanning for their ship, try to pick up their warp trail.#
TRAVIS: I think I found them.#
TRAVIS: Point five two light years from here.#
TRAVIS: I already have. I've been sending out hails but we're still out of comm. range.#
TRAVIS: You speak English.#
TRAVIS: Okay. We have a problem.#
TRAVIS: There'an alien organism on our ship.#
TRAVIS: It came aboard around the same time we saw you. We were hoping you might know something about it.#
TRAVIS: Well, it's big, but it didn't start out that way. It's like a large mass of tendrils.#
TRAVIS: Like a giant web, but it moves and grows.#
TRAVIS: Where?#
TRAVIS: Can you tell us where this planet is?#
TRAVIS: Excuse me?#
TRAVIS: That's the thing. We don't know what we did to offend you.#
TRAVIS: You mean eat.#
TRAVIS: I don't understand.#
TRAVIS: We were just eating. How do you eat?#
TRAVIS: I see. Okay. Please believe me, we had no idea that would be offensive to you. It was simply a misunderstanding. On behalf of the entire crew, I sincerely apologise.#
TRAVIS: Thank you. Now, could I have those coordinates?#
TRAVIS: Look at this. They've got sea rays the size of shuttlepods.#
TRAVIS: I've never done it, but if there was ever a time to learn. 'Your guides are genetically enhanced to breathe underwater.' And they're all female.#
TRAVIS: How about you, Lieutenant?#
TRAVIS: Entering orbit, sir.#
TRAVIS: A small craft's approaching, sir.#
TRAVIS: An unidentified vessel, sir, fifty thousand kilometres and closing.#
TRAVIS: They're closing, fast.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: You've been to Risa, haven't you?#
TRAVIS: How's the ocean?#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. Warp four point eight.#
TRAVIS: Warp four point nine.#
TRAVIS: At this speed, a little over two hours, but I don't think we can hold it that long.#
TRAVIS: They're increasing speed. Warp four point nine five.#
TRAVIS: Four point nine three, nine five.#
TRAVIS: Four point nine seven.#
TRAVIS: Four point nine nine. Warp five.#
TRAVIS: They're right on top of us.#
TRAVIS: We're dropping to impulse.#
TRAVIS: Well, we can't just leave them down there. What about the transporter?#
TRAVIS: Rock-climbing, sir. There's a place called Galartha. The cliff face changes pitch while you climb it.#
TRAVIS: Well, if it's easy, what's the point?#
TRAVIS: What about you, Captain?#
TRAVIS: The fun part is the way the rock face changes. The problem is the handholds change, too.#
TRAVIS: Have you ever been to an alien hospital?#
TRAVIS: Well, these people have never treated a human before. I wanted my own doctor. Where's Phlox?#
TRAVIS: What do you mean, he's not available?#
TRAVIS: Well, wake him up. He's got a patient.#
TRAVIS: Hibernating? For how long?#
TRAVIS: Just a hypospray for the pain. Is something wrong?#
TRAVIS: I feel terrible.#
TRAVIS: I really think we should wake up Doctor Phlox.#
TRAVIS: It's Travis, Doctor.#
TRAVIS: What?#
TRAVIS: A lot better. Thanks, Doc.#
TRAVIS: Did you see that?#
TRAVIS: I'm coming around. Bring the grappler online.#
TRAVIS: Hoshi.#
TRAVIS: What is it?#
TRAVIS: Traces of borocarbons.#
TRAVIS: You think they've replaced you in Brazil yet?#
TRAVIS: After a year on Enterprise, the thought of a cargo ship is pretty unappealing.#
TRAVIS: Or maybe infamous. From what Commander Tucker tells me, people back home think that we're doing nothing out here but getting in trouble.#
TRAVIS: The docked ship is moving away.#
TRAVIS: So if we can't pick the locks, what about the shafts that house the EPS conduits?#
TRAVIS: There's no one else that can get through those crawlspaces, unless we could reach Crewman Naiman.#
TRAVIS: The antimatter stream's back to normal.#
TRAVIS: Hull plating on the port-aft quarter's down.#
TRAVIS: They're closing.#
TRAVIS: Port hull plating's down. Ventral plating as well.#
TRAVIS: Why waste ammunition? They have us surrounded.#
TRAVIS: Sub-Commander?#
TRAVIS: One Cell ship approaching aft.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain, something just struck the ship. Starboard side upper aft quadrant.#
TRAVIS: Some kind of cloaked ship?#
TRAVIS: I believe so.#
TRAVIS: Sir, they're hailing us.#
TRAVIS: They're charging weapons.#
TRAVIS: They missed our starboard nacelle by less than twenty metres.#
TRAVIS: The orbits of those mines are pretty erratic, sir. It's going to be tricky.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: I see it.#
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir, but I'd prefer to stay at my post.#
TRAVIS: We're being hailed.#
TRAVIS: Six hundred metres.#
TRAVIS: Sub-commander.#
TRAVIS: No response.#
TRAVIS: I see them. Bearing two one three mark four. Closing in.#
TRAVIS: A hundred metres more. Fifty. I've got them. Sealing Launch bay doors.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Sir.#
TRAVIS: Some kind of mechanical arms are being attached to the outer hull.#
TRAVIS: Mayweather.#
TRAVIS: I thought that section was off-limits, sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain? Hello? Hello?#
TRAVIS: Sir?#
TRAVIS: Much better, sir. Thank you. The doctor told me what happened. I'm not sure I understand.#
TRAVIS: Why would it do that?#
TRAVIS: What about all those other people?#
TRAVIS: Sounds good, sir.#
TRAVIS: Lieutenant, a ship just dropped out of warp. Six hundred thousand kilometres and closing.#
TRAVIS: I'm reading twelve biosigns, all Klingon.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: It's not you that I'm worried about.#
TRAVIS: Pernaia Prime. Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: Where exactly will we be going?#
TRAVIS: Don't move.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: He kicked over the table!#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain.#
TRAVIS: There's something funny up here, sir. Think you could take a look?#
TRAVIS: After I got the board running, I brought life support up to level three. As soon as I got more light in here, I noticed some condensation on this sub-panel.#
TRAVIS: Our scanner showed everything powered down.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: I think I know why he was so nervous about us firing at him while he was over here. Look at this.#
TRAVIS: Guard towers, gun emplacements, it's not a hotel.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Maybe this panel isn't the cloaking device.#
TRAVIS: This would be a lot easier if there was a button marked cloak.#
TRAVIS: Are you all right?#
TRAVIS: Maybe a little more than that.#
TRAVIS: Any change?#
TRAVIS: Having a cloaked hand could have its advantages. Be useful in a poker match.#
TRAVIS: It might be helpful on movie night, if you bring a date. In case you want to steal some popcorn.#
TRAVIS: Is it working?#
TRAVIS: What was that?#
TRAVIS: Primary and backups.#
TRAVIS: We did.#
TRAVIS: It'd be a lot easier if they stop firing at us.#
TRAVIS: The shuttlepod's right where you left it, sir. We'll be there in two minutes.#
TRAVIS: I've got a little headache. Nothing serious.#
TRAVIS: I was hoping you could just give me something. I'm right in the middle of upgrading the navigation sensors.#
TRAVIS: No.#
TRAVIS: A couple of days, on and off.#
TRAVIS: You think it could have something to do with that?#
TRAVIS: How much longer is this going to take?#
TRAVIS: On what?#
TRAVIS: I have to get back to the Bridge.#
TRAVIS: The Captain needs those upgrades, Doctor.#
TRAVIS: But your scans didn't show anything.#
TRAVIS: Doctor?#
TRAVIS: When are you going to#
TRAVIS: I have just enough time to shower and get changed.#
TRAVIS: I haven't slept all night and I'm supposed to go on duty in fifteen minutes.#
TRAVIS: A what?#
TRAVIS: No more tests. I have to get to the Bridge.#
TRAVIS: If I don't finish those upgrades, I could get a reprimand. It'll be in my permanent record.#
TRAVIS: What does that mean?#
TRAVIS: Can't it wait until after my shift?#
TRAVIS: If the Captain doesn't think I can handle my duties, I'll be scrubbing plasma conduits on D Deck for the next five years. I could be court-martialed.#
TRAVIS: Not today. Not during my shift. Unless you're ready to tie me to a biobed, I'm going back to my helm.#
TRAVIS: That's all I wanted in the first place.#
TRAVIS: What did you#
TRAVIS: A little tired, but the headache's gone. What'd you do?#
TRAVIS: Captain.#
TRAVIS: But that's what you said, though.#
TRAVIS: So, what was it like?#
TRAVIS: You can't go on a survival overnight without hearing a story about someone seeing Ramsey's molecules rematerialising on a foggy night.#
TRAVIS: Death Valley, California. Middle of July, naturally. You?#
TRAVIS: You don't take me anywhere.#
TRAVIS: : Aye, Captain.#
TRAVIS: He hasn't gotten far at warp two, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain.#
TRAVIS: He's moving off.#
TRAVIS: Our warp drive won't engage.#
TRAVIS: He's moving out of sensor range. I've lost him.#
TRAVIS: Maybe we should open a window.#
TRAVIS: And don't forget Porthos, and all the Doctor's animals.#
TRAVIS: Ran into a Class three once. Had to take shelter in the ship's core. We were down there for six weeks.#
TRAVIS: Any idea about a latrine?#
TRAVIS: Not much room for a Captain's chair.#
TRAVIS: We only got worried when the generators went down. We lost the grav-plating, life support. I'll never forget that look in my father's eyes. He knew we were in trouble.#
TRAVIS: Spatial turbulence.#
TRAVIS: Aft stabilisers aren't engaging.#
TRAVIS: Grav-shear's dropping.#
TRAVIS: That should be the worst of it, sir, at least for now.#
TRAVIS: We've got a cluster of plasma eddies about eighty thousand kilometres ahead. I should be able to steer clear of them.#
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain.#
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir. Good night.#
TRAVIS: Broccoli?#
TRAVIS: Call.#
TRAVIS: Anyone know what they're showing tonight?#
TRAVIS: I think something's burning.#
TRAVIS: It'll take a minute, sir.#
TRAVIS: We're too close to the eddy. We've got to veer off.#
TRAVIS: We've got no choice.#
TRAVIS: Malcolm?#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: It's the Dekendi's favourite sport.#
TRAVIS: They said it was an honour. It looked easy enough.#
TRAVIS: They've got these fargans. They're kind of like cows with humps, and they love melons. I think they're melons. So, four guys get into this big circle filled with fargans and they throw these melons back and forth. They use sticks with metal baskets at the end. Do you play monkey-in-the-middle on Denobula?#
TRAVIS: Anyway, after a while, the fargans start figuring out what's going on, and#
TRAVIS: Thanks, Doc. Commander.#
TRAVIS: Three hours at their present speed.#
TRAVIS: They just dropped out of warp. They'll be here in thirteen minutes.#
TRAVIS: Fifty thousand kilometres. They're still heading right for the Vulcan ships.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: The Andorians are following, sir.#
TRAVIS: We're more than thirty light years from the nearest trade route. I don't see how he could have made it out this far.#
TRAVIS: There's nothing here that looks like a power source.#
TRAVIS: Sir, a vessel's dropped out of warp. They're on an intercept course.#
TRAVIS: They're moving off.#
TRAVIS: I've lost them, sir.#
TRAVIS: Twenty thousand kilometres and closing.#
TRAVIS: We're losing speed.#
TRAVIS: Captain.#
TRAVIS: Engines are down.#
TRAVIS: The Cell-Ships. They've been destroyed.#
TRAVIS: All of them. The Tholians are on an intercept course.#
TRAVIS: Two of their ships are approaching the saucer section. Eighty metres. forty.#
TRAVIS: Sir, it's gone.#
TRAVIS: The transport's dropped out of warp. It's entered a binary system.        Looks like they're heading for the fourth planet.#
TRAVIS: There's a small vessel dropping out of warp.#
TRAVIS: The fourth planet.#
TRAVIS: They're gaining on us, sir.#
TRAVIS: How do we know the security officers are okay?#
TRAVIS: Go ahead, sir.#
TRAVIS: No problem, sir.#
TRAVIS: I'm on my way.#
TRAVIS: Mayweather to the Bridge.#
TRAVIS: One of those things just followed me up the starboard strut, but when I got into the catwalk it didn't come through. There must be something keeping it from getting in here.#
TRAVIS: I'm fine, sir. Thank you.#
TRAVIS: I saw him down near the Command Compartment.#
TRAVIS: How many of them are there?#
TRAVIS: I'm not sure.#
TRAVIS: Are you doing all right?#
TRAVIS: I'm sure the Captain will get us out as soon as he can. Has anyone seen Commander Tucker?#
TRAVIS: Thanks.#
TRAVIS: Sorry, Captain, I can't find Commander Tucker.#
TRAVIS: I'll look again.#
TRAVIS: Commander, I've been looking all over for you! Are you all right, sir?#
TRAVIS: The Captain asked me to find you. He needs you in the Command Compartment. Commander!#
TRAVIS: You can't go out there, sir. It's not safe!#
TRAVIS: What are you doing?#
TRAVIS: We've got a problem, Captain.#
TRAVIS: Commander Tucker. He just went out the forward hatch.#
TRAVIS: I tried to stop him, sir. He didn't look like himself. I think one of those things got inside him.#
TRAVIS:  Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: Their port engine is venting reactor coolant. I can try to come in on the starboard side, but it'll be tricky.#
TRAVIS: If we could disable their engines.#
TRAVIS: They're on intercept course. Two hundred thousand kilometres and closing.#
TRAVIS: What's this Rura Pente like?#
TRAVIS: Mayweather.#
TRAVIS: I'm on my way.#
TRAVIS: This system's almost thirty light years behind us.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Do you have a minute, sir?#
TRAVIS: I was wondering if I could make a personal request.#
TRAVIS: My family's ship, the Horizon, we're going to be passing close to it. I wouldn't mind going by for a visit. It's about ten hours off our flight path. Enterprise can still get to the planet with time to spare. You could pick me up on the way back.#
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.#
TRAVIS: My father's been ill for a few months.#
TRAVIS: My mother said he'll be fine. She's the ship's medic.#
TRAVIS: She's both.#
TRAVIS: My grandfather held the record. Five jobs at one time, two of them on the bridge.#
TRAVIS: You, sir?#
TRAVIS: Why didn't you sign up?#
TRAVIS: I'd appreciate that, sir.#
TRAVIS: Starfleet really ought to think about putting families on starships.#
TRAVIS: No one would ever get homesick.#
TRAVIS: On a cargo ship, you can't walk ten metres without running into your baby-sitter or a great-aunt.#
TRAVIS:  Go ahead.#
TRAVIS: Thanks, Hoshi. Put it through to my quarters.#
TRAVIS: Of course not.#
TRAVIS: Every now and then.#
TRAVIS: My mother sent a message to Starfleet six weeks ago, but I never got it.#
TRAVIS: I should have called him. We were in comm. range a few months ago. I guess I wasn't ready to talk to him yet. He wasn't very happy with me when I joined Starfleet. He'd been grooming me for his job since I was kid.#
TRAVIS: With all respect, sir, I'm not so sure he was.#
TRAVIS: What did he say?#
TRAVIS: I wish he would have told me that.#
TRAVIS: The Horizon's fifty years old. I'm sure you've seen far more impressive warp reactors.#
TRAVIS: What's this?#
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.#
TRAVIS: I wouldn't call it a dangerous mission. We've gotten into a few skirmishes, but nothing we couldn't handle.#
TRAVIS: We ran into a small wavefront a few months ago. The crew had to squeeze into one of the nacelles for a couple of days. She probably made it sound worse than it was.#
TRAVIS: It was really just a misunderstanding. They thought Enterprise had been abandoned. Captain Archer convinced them to leave.#
TRAVIS: How'd you know about that?#
TRAVIS: Charlie must be at the helm.#
TRAVIS: His warp jumps were always a little rough. Where are we headed?#
TRAVIS: Hey!#
TRAVIS: Do you always have to bring that up?#
TRAVIS: I will.#
TRAVIS: Guest quarters are over here.#
TRAVIS: I thought my room had been reassigned.#
TRAVIS: I can't believe you kept this.#
TRAVIS: I've still got a ways to go.#
TRAVIS: Me, too.  We're going to get through this, Mom.#
TRAVIS: Are you sure you're old enough to drive that thing?#
TRAVIS: Acting captain. Don't let it go to your head.#
TRAVIS: The jacket looks good on you.#
TRAVIS: Business must be good. I've never seen this module so full.#
TRAVIS: If you need me to help out with anything.#
TRAVIS: See you at dinner?#
TRAVIS: All right, try it now.  I've increased the range of the navigation sensors. The helm will make course corrections a lot quicker.#
TRAVIS: I'm just working on a few upgrades.#
TRAVIS: You were busy. I didn't want to bother you. You're going to love this. You know those port stabilisers that were always acting up? Before I left, I spoke with Commander Tucker.#
TRAVIS: Our Chief Engineer, on Enterprise. He showed me how to reconfigure the spatial discriminators. Shouldn't give you any more trouble.#
TRAVIS: Whatever you say, sir.#
TRAVIS: Come in.#
TRAVIS: Word travels fast.#
TRAVIS: Thanks.#
TRAVIS: I don't know. I thought it might be fun to regress for a while. What do you say we turn off the grav-plating and jump on the bed?#
TRAVIS: Keeps us busy. We've gone a hundred and fifty light years, seen twenty two inhabited worlds.#
TRAVIS: You can't believe what's out there.#
TRAVIS: Just a few days.#
TRAVIS: I'm afraid not. I doubt Magellan got much time off, either. What's wrong?#
TRAVIS: What do you mean?#
TRAVIS: He's always on edge.#
TRAVIS: My mother hasn't mentioned any of this.#
TRAVIS: He's only been in command a few weeks. Give him a chance. He'll grow into it.#
TRAVIS: Thanks.#
TRAVIS: Charlie at the helm?#
TRAVIS: That's no turbulence.#
TRAVIS: What's going on?#
TRAVIS: By who?#
TRAVIS: You're hauling thirty thousand metric tons. You're not going to be able to outrun them.#
TRAVIS: They're still closing.#
TRAVIS: They attached something to the hull.#
TRAVIS: I wouldn't recommend that. This is a dicobalt signature, a high-yield explosive. If anyone gets too close, it might decide to go off.#
TRAVIS: What kind of weapons does the Constellation have?#
TRAVIS: What happens if they come back before we arrive?#
TRAVIS: I've seen this kind of engine configuration before. It's not that different from a Mazarite ship.#
TRAVIS: We had some trouble with them. We managed to knock out their engines with our phase cannons.#
TRAVIS: I can tie the plasma turrets directly into the impulse engines. Lieutenant Reed did that and it increased our yield by eighty percent.#
TRAVIS: If there's one thing I've learned from Captain Archer, it's that you don't give in to people like this. You're only going to encourage more attacks, not just against you, but other cargo ships.#
TRAVIS: If those aliens come back, you'll thank me.#
TRAVIS: You may not have a choice.#
TRAVIS: Paul.#
TRAVIS: I didn't mean to undermine your authority.#
TRAVIS: But you're being unreasonable. I just want us to be prepared.#
TRAVIS: It's still my home.#
TRAVIS: Is that what this is about? Me leaving? If you want to be an effective captain, you've got to set your personal feelings aside, listen to what other people have to say.#
TRAVIS: No, your father. He said that to me a long time ago. If he was here now, he'd tell you the same thing.#
TRAVIS: That isn't fair.#
TRAVIS: You want to stand around feeling sorry for yourself, go ahead. I've got better things to do.#
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to help you, Paul. In case you haven't noticed, you could use a little help right now.#
TRAVIS: You want to take them offline? Do it yourself.;#
TRAVIS: I knew how Paul would react. I didn't want to drag you into it.#
TRAVIS:  Never thought I'd actually miss these.#
TRAVIS: Not just any Nutri-pak, strawberry shortcake. The first time I tasted real shortcake was in San Francisco. It just wasn't the same.#
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind eating like this again. I'm thinking about asking for an extended leave. I'm sure Captain Archer would approve, considering.#
TRAVIS: As long as I'm needed.#
TRAVIS: I'm not the only helm officer.#
TRAVIS: There's a lot for me to do here. I can help upgrade the guidance and warp systems. With a little luck, we could make Horizon the fastest J-class in the fleet.#
TRAVIS: My career's the last thing on my mind right now.#
TRAVIS: He's not ready, Mum.#
TRAVIS: You don't think I should stay.#
TRAVIS: A lot has changed in four years, Mum.#
TRAVIS: I'll try to keep that in mind. Good night.#
TRAVIS: They're charging weapons.#
TRAVIS: If I can get a clear shot, but I can't do that as long as they're behind us.#
TRAVIS: It's going to be tough to manoeuvre with thirty kilotons of cargo. We've got to cut it loose.#
TRAVIS: I'm sure it'll come back to me.#
TRAVIS: They're closing. Forty metres, thirty.#
TRAVIS: Ten metres.#
TRAVIS: I'm coming around again.#
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain.#
TRAVIS: Come in.#
TRAVIS: Wouldn't want to wear out my welcome.#
TRAVIS: If you like, I'll speak with Lieutenant Reed. I'm sure he can help you remove that alien beacon.#
TRAVIS: What?#
TRAVIS: We haven't travelled quite that far.#
TRAVIS: You can count on it.#
TRAVIS: Maybe sooner.#
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.#
TRAVIS: They're okay.#
TRAVIS: Probably an old meteorite impact.#
TRAVIS: Never better, sir.#
TRAVIS: These caverns go on for fifty kilometres.#
TRAVIS: There are some pretty steep inclines here, but I think I can handle it.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Pitons.#
TRAVIS: Ration packs.#
TRAVIS: Flex-cable?#
TRAVIS: Waste disposal units.#
TRAVIS: We take out everything we bring in.#
TRAVIS: This is the nearest entrance to their campsite. I'd be willing to bet they came this way.#
TRAVIS: Watch your footing. There's a lot of loose rock.#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: Don't worry, I'll go first.#
TRAVIS: Watch your footing, sir.#
TRAVIS: Stay calm. Commander, are you all right?#
TRAVIS: Why don't you take a break. I'll see what's below.#
TRAVIS: Stay close to the wall.#
TRAVIS: Let me lock off. Check the safety, Commander.#
TRAVIS: I can't hold this much longer.#
TRAVIS: The rope's slipping!#
TRAVIS: Is it broken?#
TRAVIS: We need to keep moving. Just give me something for the pain.#
TRAVIS: I can make it, sir.#
TRAVIS: Respectfully, sir, it's not me that I'm worried about.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: About an hour.#
TRAVIS: They're going to warp.#
TRAVIS: Sir, our warp field's destabilising.#
TRAVIS: They're accelerating, warp four point nine six, nine eight#
TRAVIS: We're closing.#
TRAVIS: They're dropping to impulse.#
TRAVIS: Hull plating's at twenty three percent.#
TRAVIS: We've lost hull plating.#
TRAVIS: The Tellarite ship's trying to undock with the seals locked.#
TRAVIS: He's going to warp.#
TRAVIS: He's disabled our starboard nacelle. We can't follow him, sir.#
TRAVIS: Less than six light years.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: I see him. Eight hundred thousand kilometres.#
TRAVIS: They're not making it easy.#
TRAVIS: Got it!#
TRAVIS: Safe and sound, Launch bay two.#
TRAVIS: It'll take a while to get back, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain, that's our sun.#
TRAVIS: Two hundred kilometres off port.#
TRAVIS: They're dropping to impulse.#
TRAVIS: Warp three, sir.#
TRAVIS: Sir?#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Nearly a million kilometres.#
TRAVIS: It's not that dense all the way through, is it?#
TRAVIS: They're keeping up with us, sir.#
TRAVIS: I can try, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain.#
TRAVIS: I hope you don't ask me to do that too often, sir.#
TRAVIS: Two hours, sir.#
TRAVIS: We've got less than a half an hour to do it.#
TRAVIS: Sir, we're approaching the coordinates.#
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up a debris field.#
TRAVIS: It's a lot bigger than that.#
TRAVIS: What course, sir?#
TRAVIS: The warp field's fluctuating.#
TRAVIS: We're losing main power.#
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up a vessel eight million kilometres off port.#
TRAVIS: Looks like they're holding position, or they could be adrift.#
TRAVIS: One quarter impulse.#
TRAVIS: Three thousand metres and closing.#
TRAVIS: Two thousand metres.#
TRAVIS: The trail ends about twenty thousand kilometres ahead.#
TRAVIS: Nothing.#
TRAVIS: Shall I alter course?#
TRAVIS: I'm not reading anything.#
TRAVIS: Not with Enterprise.#
TRAVIS: There's no indication of any ships, sir.#
TRAVIS: There's enough energy running through here to power a dozen cities.#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.#
TRAVIS: Over here, sir.#
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure it's a cargo manifest.#
TRAVIS: Not very good, sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Look at this.#
TRAVIS: Their ion trail's already started to decay. They're going to be hard to find.#
TRAVIS: Something's passing through the cloaking field.#
TRAVIS: They're moving off.#
TRAVIS: They're heading back into the cloaking field.#
TRAVIS: Stand by.#
TRAVIS: Our impulse drive's destabilising. We've got to get out of the cloaking field, sir.#
TRAVIS: Still inside the field.#
TRAVIS: No sign of them.#
TRAVIS: That got their attention. They're coming through.#
TRAVIS: Go ahead.#
TRAVIS: Sub-commander?#
TRAVIS: She said they were being altered.#
TRAVIS: Whoever they are, they're not staying put. They're heading due east of the landing site.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: They're hailing us.#
TRAVIS: Put him through. Go ahead, sir.#
TRAVIS: Understood.#
TRAVIS: They're in pursuit. Two thousand kilometres and closing.#
TRAVIS: Nine hundred kilometres.#
TRAVIS: Seven hundred.#
TRAVIS: Hull plating's down to forty percent.#
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.#
TRAVIS: Aye sir.#
TRAVIS: Those ships just entered some kind of vortex. They're gone.#
TRAVIS: I've got a lock.#
TRAVIS: There's an overload in the resequencer.#
TRAVIS: I can't.#
TRAVIS: What if I could put a shuttlepod down on one of the big ones.#
TRAVIS: I can try.#
TRAVIS: There isn't a flat spot much bigger than my quarters.#
TRAVIS: Let's go. I'm matching the rotational velocity.#
TRAVIS: Got it.#
TRAVIS: I hope you won't write that landing up in your log.#
TRAVIS: I heard about the accident you and T'Pol had in the lab.#
TRAVIS: But you're sure this stuff is safe to bring on board?#
TRAVIS: Grab a seat, Commander.#
TRAVIS: The starboard thruster's failing.#
TRAVIS: We're clear. We've only got one thruster left.#
TRAVIS: I think so.#
TRAVIS: It broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.#
TRAVIS: The helm�s not responding. The starboard injectors are fused.#
TRAVIS: We can't transport six thousand people back to Earth.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. Four point five, four point six, four point seven, four point eight.#
TRAVIS: Four point nine.#
TRAVIS: I've lost helm control.#
TRAVIS: Helm control is still down.#
TRAVIS: Shuttlepod two. Acknowledged.#
TRAVIS: Thrust vector holding steady.#
TRAVIS: I've got a temperature warning light.#
TRAVIS: Twelve kilometres per hour and accelerating.#
TRAVIS: Like they came off an assembly line.#
TRAVIS: Power fluctuations.#
TRAVIS: We're coming up on the outer edge of the cloaking barrier.#
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.#
TRAVIS: There's a convoy of ships approaching.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Which way, Sub-Commander?#
TRAVIS: The helm's not responding.#
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up something out there. I think it's a ship.#
TRAVIS: There's too much distortion.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Two Xindi ships approaching.#
TRAVIS: Aye.#
TRAVIS: They're heading back into the system.#
TRAVIS: Already on it, sir.#
TRAVIS: I'm picking up a ship at the edge of the system.#
TRAVIS: They're making a run for it.#
TRAVIS: Radiation from the debris field. It's starting to affect our systems.#
TRAVIS: The port hydraulics are acting up.#
TRAVIS: They're not responding.#
TRAVIS: I'll try to do better next time, sir.#
TRAVIS: I can't understand it, Captain. It's like the stars keep shifting positions.#
TRAVIS: There, they just did it again.#
TRAVIS: I've already run two diagnostics. I can't find anything wrong.#
TRAVIS: Helm's not responding.#
TRAVIS: Helm's back online.#
TRAVIS: Love to.#
TRAVIS: Good, sir. We're adjusting the nav sensors to compensate for the gravimetric waves.#
TRAVIS: Just need a day to upload and test these corrections.#
TRAVIS: Good match.#
TRAVIS: No, sir.#
TRAVIS: For an Insectoid, maybe they are comfortable.#
TRAVIS: You could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant.#
TRAVIS: This icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds.#
TRAVIS: I don't think this ship likes us very much.#
TRAVIS: What about the ship on the surface? We might be able to salvage what we need.#
TRAVIS: Every day we stay here gives them more time to finish their weapon.#
TRAVIS: A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.#
TRAVIS: They're firing.#
TRAVIS: They're moving away at full impulse.#
TRAVIS: No effect.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Captain, we're not exactly experts at piloting that thing.#
TRAVIS: I think I've found reverse.#
TRAVIS: Can't argue with that.#
TRAVIS: Closed.#
TRAVIS: Thanks, Captain.#
TRAVIS: It's like steering an asteroid miner with a bad axis coil.#
TRAVIS: I think I'm getting a feel for her.#
TRAVIS: Doesn't exactly sound like welcome to the neighbourhood.#
TRAVIS: There's not much land down there.#
TRAVIS: See something?#
TRAVIS: You did say that most of this thing's power was routed to structural integrity.#
TRAVIS: Structural integrity's holding.#
TRAVIS: Are you getting those scans, sir?#
TRAVIS: The Captain said get in and get out.#
TRAVIS: Aye, aye.#
TRAVIS: I should be the one to go.#
TRAVIS: I'm the only one who can pilot that shuttle.#
TRAVIS: But I've actually done it.#
TRAVIS: Aye sir.#
TRAVIS: I know these controls aren't exactly intuitive.#
TRAVIS: Try again. Good, you're starting to think like an insectoid.#
TRAVIS: Can I ask you something?#
TRAVIS: You're the least expendable man on Enterprise. Why are you doing this?#
TRAVIS: Sounds like you're saying this is some sort of penance.#
TRAVIS: I still don't have helm control.#
TRAVIS: Thrusters are down. I don't think we're going anywhere.#
TRAVIS: There's a vessel approaching.#
TRAVIS: Still offline.#
TRAVIS: Aye sir.#
TRAVIS: Almost sounds like music.#
TRAVIS: It's never too late. You can start when we get home. We're getting home.#
TRAVIS: The escape pod can manoeuvre underwater. Aside from that, nothing out of the ordinary.#
TRAVIS: Why don't we just transport their warp coil to Enterprise?#
TRAVIS: Two hundred kilometres.#
TRAVIS: Our port thrusters are offline.#
TRAVIS: We're approaching the coordinates, Captain. Right on schedule.#
TRAVIS: Maybe they're running late?#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: He's nearly reached the Reptilians.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: Whoever they are, they're on an intercept course.#
TRAVIS: We're losing speed.#
TRAVIS: Captain, the stars. They're not where they're supposed to be.#
TRAVIS: Who's the father?#
TRAVIS: Why not? You've got to be curious.#
TRAVIS: Corporal Mackenzie.#
TRAVIS: We talked after a training session once.#
TRAVIS: Please.#
TRAVIS: I'm on duty in a few minutes.#
TRAVIS: Warp engines just went offline. Our plasma injectors are disengaged.#
TRAVIS: They're making a run for it.#
TRAVIS: Two thousand metres.#
TRAVIS: Six minutes.#
TRAVIS: Sir, we're losing speed.#
TRAVIS: We're increasing speed. They've engaged a tractor beam.#
TRAVIS: Forty five seconds to the corridor.#
TRAVIS: Twelve seconds to the corridor.#
TRAVIS: The stars are where they're supposed to be.#
TRAVIS: A ship's dropping out of warp.#
TRAVIS: Five seconds, three, two.#
TRAVIS: RCS inverter.#
TRAVIS: Nothing we need to worry about sir.#
TRAVIS: You sure about this?#
TRAVIS: Aye.#
TRAVIS: I'm detecting some kind of movement.#
TRAVIS: There's too much interference. I don't know where it is#
TRAVIS: Whatever it was, it's stopped moving. Got something! It's heading in your direction.#
TRAVIS: It's coming down from the upper#
TRAVIS: It's seventy metres away. Fifty metres, thirty, fifteen!#
TRAVIS: Five more headed this way. Move!#
TRAVIS: It was that last run through the cloaking barrier. The coil assembly's been damaged.#
TRAVIS: There's a large group of ships leaving the system. One of them is Enterprise. I'm detecting weapons fire.#
TRAVIS: What have we missed?#
TRAVIS: Have they launched it?#
TRAVIS: Who?#
TRAVIS: We'll have to pull back.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: What about the anomalies?#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: I think we've got a problem.#
TRAVIS: Sphere Forty One.#
TRAVIS: Yep. There shouldn't be anything on sensors, not with the cloaking barrier, but there it is and it's getting bigger.#
TRAVIS: Could be spatial anomalies, but they're clustered much tighter than we've ever seen them.#
TRAVIS: You wanted to see me, sir?#
TRAVIS: When?#
TRAVIS: Sir.#
TRAVIS: That's tying my hands, Commander, especially with the ticking clock.#
TRAVIS: It's grown. It's a hundred thousand kilometres deeper than when we first detected it.#
TRAVIS: Here we go.#
TRAVIS: It's too soon.#
TRAVIS: I've got it.#
TRAVIS: Twenty thousand kilometres.#
TRAVIS: Fifteen degrees north.#
TRAVIS: Aye.#
TRAVIS: Me too.#
TRAVIS: I'm picking up explosions on E deck.#
TRAVIS: How's that possible?#
TRAVIS: Eight hundred thousand kilometres.#
TRAVIS: I'm not picking up the orbital platforms.#
TRAVIS: It's not just Yosemite. There's nothing coming from any of them.#
TRAVIS: Looks pretty normal to me.#
TRAVIS: Finally. We've got three vessels approaching.#
TRAVIS: Sir.#
TRAVIS: Those are P-51s. I've seen them at air shows.#
TRAVIS: Are they breaking off? Maybe we should follow them.#
TRAVIS: Starboard injector.#
TRAVIS: Maybe we're here for a reason. Maybe this wasn't an accident.#
TRAVIS: Bay one is depressurising. Someone's launching a shuttlepod.#
TRAVIS: Hard to believe we're only a few kilometres from New York City.#
TRAVIS: Aggressive?#
TRAVIS: I overheard them talking. They mentioned something about a Temporal conduit. I know it sounds crazy, but I think it's a time machine.#
TRAVIS: Aye.#
TRAVIS: Captain.#
TRAVIS: You had to wear that jacket.#
TRAVIS: You're not chasing anyone out of here.#
TRAVIS: You heard him. Step away from the table.#
TRAVIS: I remember Soong's trial. He wouldn't say what he did with the embryos he stole.#
TRAVIS: Not a pretty thought.#
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.#
TRAVIS: There's another ship.#
TRAVIS: Range twenty million kilometers.#
TRAVIS: Course set.#
TRAVIS: Five thousand kilometres.#
TRAVIS: The bird-of-prey's moving to intercept.#
TRAVIS: They've dropped to impulse.#
TRAVIS: Another fifteen seconds.#
TRAVIS: Lieutenant, here's the junction room.#
TRAVIS: Schematics say the secondary security bank's right in there.#
TRAVIS: There's a weak power signature under this mess.#
TRAVIS: Lieutenant.#
TRAVIS: Why not beam the bomb out of here?#
TRAVIS: Attempt?#
TRAVIS: That can't be good.#
TRAVIS: We should be ready within the hour.#
TRAVIS: I've rigged up a stick-and-rudder system. It'll get us where we want to go,#
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.#
TRAVIS: Understood.#
TRAVIS: These thermals are only going to get stronger.#
TRAVIS: We must be getting close to the geomagnetic field.#
TRAVIS: They must have better shielding.#
TRAVIS: We've lost part of the starboard wing.#
TRAVIS: I think I can get us down.#
TRAVIS: Thrusters are offline. We'll have to fire the chemical rockets. Hang on.#
TRAVIS: Sir.#
TRAVIS: Sir, the Andorians are moving toward the nebula.#
TRAVIS: Navigation just went offline.#
TRAVIS: I've lost them.#
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm reading a massive subspace distortion.#
TRAVIS: We're being targeted.#
TRAVIS: I've lost helm control.#
TRAVIS: You'll win in eight moves.#
TRAVIS: Thirty two pieces, sixty four squares. It's not as if it's difficult. The total number of possible outcomes is limited.#
TRAVIS: That's what I mean. Chess is so predictable, I'm surprised anyone bothers to play it.#
TRAVIS: What a waste.#
TRAVIS: I know the rules. Observation without interference.#
TRAVIS: You'll win in five moves.#
TRAVIS: How do you think they'll react to what's on this planet?#
TRAVIS: Do you think our hosts will die tonight?#
TRAVIS: But somebody always dies.#
TRAVIS: I studied your report on how the Klingons reacted to the infection.#
TRAVIS: The Klingon commander didn't let his landing party back on his ship.#
TRAVIS: Captain Archer did.#
TRAVIS: So it doesn't matter if an infected landing party comes aboard.#
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know. They're showing concern for each other. The Cardassians did that when they were here, didn't they?#
TRAVIS: Maybe the humans will surprise us.#
TRAVIS: Commander, Hoshi. Just wanted to say hi.#
TRAVIS: Can you tell me what's in the hypospray?#
TRAVIS: Have either of you faced serious illness before?#
TRAVIS: I was curious to know how you'd compare this experience with other illnesses you might've contracted.#
TRAVIS: I only have a few more questions.#
TRAVIS: But#
TRAVIS: The Doctor identified the pathogen.#
TRAVIS: But no one's made the decision to abandon the infected crew members.#
TRAVIS: We're looking for signs of elevated intelligence in the species we observe.#
TRAVIS: I'm sure Captain Archer knows exactly what the risk is. Maybe it's not as important to him as standing by his crew.#
TRAVIS: There's a way to be sure.#
TRAVIS: Which is why we should inhabit the Doctor and the Science Officer. Archer relies on their findings to make his decisions. We could witness that as it happens.#
TRAVIS: The more people we inhabit, the more we'll be able to observe.#
TRAVIS: You've detected a debris cloud in orbit.#
TRAVIS: Captain, does knowing what the Klingons did help us at all?#
TRAVIS: But if they had developed one, you'd ask them for it, right?#
TRAVIS: We can stop what this virus is doing to them.#
TRAVIS: We came to observe their response to the unexpected, not to watch them suffer.#
TRAVIS: I know where we can talk undisturbed.#
TRAVIS: In eight hundred years, no one's ever done that before?#
TRAVIS: How many have to die before you'll admit humans are different? We need to stop this.#
TRAVIS: What more will that teach us about them?#
TRAVIS: Maybe we should be.#
TRAVIS: Good. I'm looking forward to making my first report. After ten thousand years, the rules need to change.#
TRAVIS: I don't think we can avoid them. I'm going to recommend that we start preparations for an official First Contact mission.#
TRAVIS: Then we'd better get started.#
TRAVIS: They have no ships within range.#
TRAVIS: Two hours.#
TRAVIS: Our warp field's destabilising. We're dropping to impulse.#
TRAVIS: Starboard thrusters are down.#
TRAVIS: They're moving off.#
TRAVIS: Sir.#
TRAVIS: We're losing hull plating.#
TRAVIS: Warp four point nine.#
TRAVIS: Warp five.#
TRAVIS: Five point oh two. Point oh four. Five point oh six.#
TRAVIS: The injector's stabilised. We're holding speed.#
TRAVIS: The one thing they couldn't mask is their power signature. That's why they#
TRAVIS: Why does Starfleet think this is connected to the other incidents?#
TRAVIS: Didn't expect to find you up this late.#
TRAVIS: Too wired to sleep. Hard to believe the Captain's going to be fighting a duel to the death in a few hours.#
TRAVIS: What are you looking at?#
TRAVIS: The last I heard, the Captain sounded determined to go through with it.#
TRAVIS: Two of us could get through that a lot faster.#
TRAVIS: Look at this. Either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitely if there are no children to continue his clan.#
TRAVIS: As far as I know, Captain Archer doesn't have any kids. If he's killed, his clan would die with him.#
TRAVIS: Don't suppose we can find him a wife in the next four hours.#
TRAVIS: Instead of looking for a loophole, maybe we should be trying to find a way for the Captain to win.#
TRAVIS: Have you ever been to Nobelia Prime?#
TRAVIS: The tribal elders there, they can challenge you to a duel if you look at them the wrong way. Happened to my father.#
TRAVIS: Which one of these has the combat rules?#
TRAVIS: Intercept in forty seven minutes.#
TRAVIS: One minute.#
TRAVIS: They're targeting our warp core. Hull plating's at forty three percent.  Thirty six percent.#
TRAVIS: One hundred kilometres.#
TRAVIS: At our current speed, eight point two hours.#
TRAVIS: They're going to warp.#
TRAVIS: The helm's not responding.#
TRAVIS: There's a malfunction in the intermix chamber. Plasma pressure's rising.#
TRAVIS: Pressure's approaching critical.#
TRAVIS: Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.#
TRAVIS: Acknowledged.#
TRAVIS: Coming up on one hundred metres. Ninety, eighty metres.#
TRAVIS: We're at fifty metres and holding.#
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm having trouble holding position. Fifty two metres. Fifty five.#
TRAVIS: Fifty nine metres.#
TRAVIS: We've got warp power.#
TRAVIS: Six hours, sir.#
TRAVIS: The lead ship's moving into a lower orbit.#
TRAVIS: They're shifting their orbit.#
TRAVIS: Lieutenant.#
TRAVIS: I ran into one of them in the corridor. They're really#
TRAVIS: Get them out of my head! The pain helps. You should try it.#
TRAVIS: When I was on my parents' ship, we picked up some Deltans once. Their ship was having engine trouble.#
TRAVIS: The females are unbelievably attractive. Very open about#
TRAVIS: I was fifteen. I couldn't think straight. I could barely breathe. Only thing that got me through it was weight training with my dad. He said if I was exhausted, idle hands and all that#
TRAVIS: Helped my biceps. I'd go heavier.#
TRAVIS: Sir, they're moving off.#
TRAVIS: Four hundred kilometres.#
TRAVIS: He's moving too fast.#
TRAVIS: Thrusters are back to full.#
TRAVIS: We're still too slow.#
TRAVIS: He's coming about.#
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. And Captain, if I may? I'd like to be the first to congratulate you on a brilliant strategy. I'm certain that in years to come.#
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain.#
TRAVIS: Sir.#
TRAVIS: Direct hits.#
TRAVIS: Target destroyed.#
TRAVIS: Weapons are locked.#
TRAVIS: The warp field's fluctuating.#
TRAVIS: I'll alert the Captain.#
TRAVIS: Main power's offline. We've dropped out of warp.#
TRAVIS: Everything's offline.#
TRAVIS: Primary systems are coming back. We have shields.#
TRAVIS: Weapons are online.#
TRAVIS: They're trying to escape.#
TRAVIS: Just missing a few names.#
TRAVIS: For what?#
TRAVIS: You were busy working.#
TRAVIS: How have you been, Gannet?#
TRAVIS: At least until the conference is over.#
TRAVIS: Can't argue with that.#
TRAVIS: What are you doing here?#
TRAVIS: A story?#
TRAVIS: I've got some work to do.#
TRAVIS: Gannet.#
TRAVIS: He know how you feel about space exploration? That it's the last vestige of colonial impulse?#
TRAVIS: Find another story to do.#
TRAVIS: Then you're going to have to find another source for your information.#
TRAVIS: Can you give me one reason why I shouldn't avoid you?#
TRAVIS: And it looks like you've changed your mind.#
TRAVIS: That's the first honest thing you've said.#
TRAVIS: That was some serious flying, trying to keep the warp fields aligned. Columbia was fifty metres above us. One wrong move and we would've lost Commander Tucker.#
TRAVIS: When I was studying to be a pilot, I memorised something Chuck Yeager said. I never let myself be afraid. I just focus on the dials and concentrate on flying.#
TRAVIS: Most of the time, simple works best.#
TRAVIS: These are the shuttlepods.#
TRAVIS: Shuttlepod One. Do you want to see inside?#
TRAVIS: I always thought so. Unfortunately, we use the shuttlepods less and less.#
TRAVIS: We're getting more comfortable with the transporter.#
TRAVIS: Yeah, but there's no skill involved.#
TRAVIS: I've always had a tendency to get attached to machines. It's crazy, but every time we use the transporter, I feel we're kind of turning our backs on these guys.#
TRAVIS: When I saw you at that conference, I started thinking about things, decisions I've made.#
TRAVIS: Don't do that.#
TRAVIS: Whenever things get a little serious, you always turn it into a joke.#
TRAVIS: You and your bad habits.#
TRAVIS: I'm glad we finally left the shuttlepod.#
TRAVIS: I like flying them.#
TRAVIS: What was that?#
TRAVIS: I'm just worried about some friends of mine.#
TRAVIS: I'm under orders not to talk about it.#
TRAVIS: Let's change the subject. How come you haven't settled down?#
TRAVIS: And what constitutes the right circumstance?#
TRAVIS: I've spent my whole life in space, going from one place to the next. Seeing you, I was wondering, maybe the next challenge, at least for me, is to stay in one place for a while.#
TRAVIS: All that stuff I said about leaving the ship.#
TRAVIS: What's going on?#
TRAVIS: Maybe she was after a story. It doesn't mean she worked for Terra Prime.#
TRAVIS: Aye.#
TRAVIS: I have experience with comets, sir.#
TRAVIS: We're within range.#
TRAVIS: Aye, aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: What's so urgent?#
TRAVIS: You'll have to talk to the Captain.#
TRAVIS: We all are. That's it?#
TRAVIS: That's not possible.#
TRAVIS: If you were an S.I. agent, you'd be out of this Brig with one call to your division head.#
TRAVIS: Mayweather, Go ahead.#
TRAVIS: On my way. You know I'm going to tell the Captain about this.#
TRAVIS: Probably not. Why are you telling me this now?#
TRAVIS: So you're revealing all of this because you're worried about me.#
TRAVIS: I'm touched.#
TRAVIS: You're not going to manipulate me again. Goodbye.#
TRAVIS: Hull plating's steady at ninety four percent.#
TRAVIS: We need to maintain an erratic flight profile, so we look like a chunk of the comet.#
TRAVIS: I'm taking us closer to the nucleus. It's going to start getting a little rough.#
TRAVIS: The gravity's starting to tear the comet apart.#
TRAVIS: The engine shut down, but there were no warning lights. The console's locked up.#
TRAVIS: Bypassing auto flight control. Switching to manual!#
TRAVIS: We're out of options.#
TRAVIS: Ground proximity?#
TRAVIS: I was thinking the same thing. You'll want to keep your arms inside the vehicle at all times.#
TRAVIS: Hmm?#
TRAVIS: Commander.#
TRAVIS: I can't figure out why the console locked up at the same time the engines shut down.#
TRAVIS: Flight control and engine power are routed separately. until they reach that junction. The panel's open. If ionised gas got in here, it could've melted the primary circuits of both systems.#
TRAVIS: No. It's been forced. This was deliberate.#
TRAVIS: Is this your signature?#
TRAVIS: It's a first step. The Captain says it's going to take years to work out the details.#
TRAVIS: Just doing my job.#
TRAVIS: I know.#
TRAVIS: A lot of details to work out.#
TRAVIS: The least I can do is give you a ride.#
TRAVIS: The Launch Bay's this way.#
TRAVIS: When are they expecting you in Brazil?#
TRAVIS: After ten years on this ship, I'll bet it'll take a while getting used to the humidity again.#
TRAVIS: He hates giving speeches.#
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.#
TRAVIS: We're going through the troposphere. Might get a little bumpy.#
TRAVIS: Go ahead, sir.#
TRAVIS: Understood.#
TRAVIS: Close to twenty years. He taught the Captain how to scuba dive somewhere off the coast of Florida.#
TRAVIS: Sorry.#
TRAVIS: They've got a shorthand they use sometimes. Comes from spending so much time together.#
TRAVIS: At who?#
TRAVIS: Not that I know of. When push comes to shove, Commander Tucker usually ends up doing the right thing. How am I doing?#
TRAVIS: Yep.#
TRAVIS: I've asked him for a little more time, until Captain Archer decides what he's going to be doing.#
TRAVIS: Malcolm's right. They'll never keep him behind a desk.#
