UHURA: I'm getting no signal from it, sir.#
UHURA: Hailing frequencies still open, sir. I get no message from it.#
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.#
UHURA: Switching, sir.#
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.#
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.#
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.#
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.#
UHURA: Hailing frequencies, sir.#
UHURA: A signal, Captain. It's very weak. It's Balok. It's a distress signal to the Fesarius. His engines are out. His life-sustaining system isn't operating. The message is repeating, sir.#
UHURA: Negative, sir. The signal is growing weak. Sir, I doubt if the mother ship could have heard it.#
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. He refuses to answer. Unless he's not receiving us.#
UHURA: I'm getting a distress signal call from them, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems worse.#
UHURA: No, sir. He and the girl are still missing.#
UHURA: Mister Spock, sometimes I think if I hear that word frequency once more, I'll cry.#
UHURA: I was just trying to start a conversation.#
UHURA: No, you have an answer. I'm an illogical woman who's beginning to feel too much a part of that communications console. Why don't you tell me I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me if I've ever been in love? Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on a lazy evening when the moon is full.#
UHURA: I'm not surprised, Mister Spock.#
UHURA: I don't believe it.#
UHURA: You explain. That means that somebody is dead and you just sit there. It could be Captain Kirk. He's the closest thing you have to a friend.#
UHURA: Message, Captain. Starship base on Caran 4 requesting explanation of our delay here, sir. Space Commander Dominguez says we have supplies he urgently needs.#
UHURA: Got it, Captain.#
UHURA: I see. So naturally, when I'm lonely I think of you.#
UHURA: Una kafeeri Hur. You're Swahili?#
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura. On my way, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, Captain.#
UHURA: He's not in supply and maintenance.#
UHURA: Check.#
UHURA: He must have been it. You know, I would have remembered a crewman like him.#
UHURA: Negative, Captain. I've checked every face on this vessel. It was not a crewman I saw.#
UHURA: Communications status, Captain.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Sir, level two, corridor three reports a disturbance. Mister Sulu chasing crewmen with a sword.#
UHURA: Sulu.#
UHURA: Sulu, give me that.#
UHURA: Sorry, neither.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Mister Spock, a fight in the aft wardroom. Security reports incidents among the crewmen are increasing.#
UHURA: All decks, alert system B two. Repeat, go to alert condition Baker two. Seal off all main sections. Stand by.#
UHURA: I can't, sir. He's cut off the alert channels.#
UHURA: I can't, sir. There's no way to do it.#
UHURA: Emergency signal, Captain. Both decks four and five. Fights and disorders.#
UHURA: I have no intercom for Sickbay. He keeps switching channels on me.#
UHURA: Sir, if I could cut him off, don't you think I#
UHURA: Yes, sir. I'll keep trying.#
UHURA: Mister Spock is not on the Bridge, Captain.#
UHURA: Yes, sir. Three and a half minutes left, Captain.#
UHURA: Excuse me, Captain. Status report.#
UHURA: I'm sorry. I did it again, didn't I.;#
UHURA:  Oh, on the starship Enterprise There's someone who's in Satan's guise Whose devil ears and devil eyes Could rip your heart from you. At first, his look could hypnotise And then his touch would barbarise His alien love could victimise And rip your heart from you. And that's why female astronauts, Oh, very female astronauts Wait terrified and overwrought To find what he will do. Oh, girls in space, be wary, be wary, be wary, Girls in space, be wary. We know not what he'll do.#
UHURA:  Now from a planet out in space, there comes a lad, not commonplace. A-seeking out his first embrace. He's saving it for you. Oh, Charlie's our new darling, our darling, our darling. Charlie's our new darling. We know not what he'll do.;#
UHURA: Can you boost your power, Antares. We're barely reading your transmission.#
UHURA: They're not transmitting.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: I think it's all right, sir. Sir, there's no reason for that panel to cross-circuit like that. I checked it over myself not fifteen minutes ago.#
UHURA: Captain Kirk, my instruments show we're receiving a message on subspace frequency three, ship-to-ship. I can't hear it, sir.#
UHURA: Sir, something off our starboard bow. The message says they're from Thasus.;#
UHURA: Charlie's back on board the Thasian ship, sir. They signal they're leaving.#
UHURA: Outpost 4 reported under attack, sir. Then message terminates.#
UHURA: No identification, sir.#
UHURA: All decks standing by, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, Captain, then Outpost three an hour later.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Sir, regaining contact with Outpost four. Switching to speakers.#
UHURA: Tied in, sir.#
UHURA: Trying to, sir. They don't acknowledge.#
UHURA: Continuing to challenge, sir. Still no response.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Picking up communication. It's from their ship.#
UHURA: Sounds like code, sir.#
UHURA: Cryptography is working on it, sir.#
UHURA: Transmission has been cut off.  I made a tape of it, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, Captain.#
UHURA:  Hailing frequencies open, sir.#
UHURA: Beginning signals to surface, sir.#
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. No return signal.#
UHURA: I've run all frequencies a second time. There's no#
UHURA: Frequency open, Mister Spock.#
UHURA: Message, Captain. Switching to speaker.#
UHURA: Security alert, condition three. All sections go to alert condition three. We may have an intruder aboard.#
UHURA: Captain, section C deck fourteen, reporting trouble. Someone in Engineering uniform.#
UHURA: Repeat, approach with extreme caution. Bridge out.#
UHURA: Transporter crewman found unconscious, Captain. Cargo case open and empty.#
UHURA: Hailing frequency's open, sir.#
UHURA: Oh, Captain, there was a message from Tantalus colony, sir.#
UHURA: Captain? A Miss Karidian has been transported aboard ship. She requests permission to see you.#
UHURA: What can I do for you, Riley?#
UHURA: Well, you're not, and I'll prove it to you.#
UHURA: I'll be back, though it takes forever#
UHURA: Where my heart is#
UHURA: How'd you like that, Riley?#
UHURA: All channels clear, sir.#
UHURA: Nothing clear, Captain. Just a few words about being pulled off course.#
UHURA: Captain, there's one planet in this solar system capable of sustaining human life. It's type M, oxygen, nitrogen, and it's listed as Taurus Two. It's unexplored. As far as we can determine with our equipment malfunction, it's just about dead-centre of the Murasaki effect.#
UHURA: Nothing, Captain.#
UHURA: All wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects, sir. Transmission is blocked, reception impossible.#
UHURA: Captain, the Columbus has returned from searching quadrant seven seven nine X by five three four M. Results negative.#
UHURA: They're working on them, sir. Still inoperable.#
UHURA: They're still reported unsafe.#
UHURA: At last report they were getting some readings#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Sir, sensor section reporting. Static interference still creating false images. Estimates eighty percent undependable.#
UHURA: Clearing slowly. Still incapable of transmission or reception.#
UHURA: Captain Kirk, landing party number two has been beamed back aboard ship. They have casualties. One dead, two injured.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: I'm in partial contact with them now, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, the sensor section says the beams are working again.#
UHURA: No, sir. Too much interference.#
UHURA: Twenty three minutes, sir.#
UHURA: The Columbus is aboard, sir. The flight hatch is closed. Transporter room reports last of the landing parties have beamed safely up. All systems report secured for warp factors.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Transporters locked in, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, transporter room just beamed up five persons. Alive and well.#
UHURA: He should have been there ten minutes ago, sir.#
UHURA: Meteorology reports ion storm upcoming, Captain.#
UHURA: Call from the pod, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Variants fading.#
UHURA: All secure, sir.#
UHURA: Starbase Operation, Mister Hansen.#
UHURA: Enterprise to Starbase. Request confirmation.#
UHURA: Come in, Starbase. Come in, Captain Kirk.#
UHURA: Someone's trying to hail us, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, Captain.#
UHURA: Negative, Captain. They're just about to start.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Strong interference on subspace, Captain. The planet must be a natural radio source.#
UHURA: All of them, Mister Spock. No response.#
UHURA: Mister Spock. Look.#
UHURA: Doctor, what was it? What was down there?#
UHURA: I don't know how to play this.#
UHURA: Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command, sir?#
UHURA: Still no sign of pursuit. Instruments clear, sir.#
UHURA: Colony Beta Six clears us for normal approach, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, sensors report we're being scanned.#
UHURA: No, sir. It's from that solar system ahead.#
UHURA: No, sir, Just scanning beams. It's on an unusual wave length.#
UHURA: There's no hostility, sir. They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, Just increasing in intensity. Steady. Regular. It's growing stronger, sir.#
UHURA: No, sir. They report they definitely emanate from that solar system ahead.#
UHURA: Nothing, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain! Are you all right?#
UHURA: Standard General Alert signal from Starfleet Command, Captain.#
UHURA: Nothing yet, sir.#
UHURA: Red Two message in one minute, Captain. Starfleet Command. Code Factor one, sir.#
UHURA: Code Factor one.#
UHURA: Message ready, Captain. Main screen, coming up.#
UHURA: Aye aye, sir.#
UHURA: Doctor McCoy asking to see you in sickbay, Captain.#
UHURA: Screen on, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, Security reports Lazarus missing.#
UHURA: Fire, Captain. Engineering. Situation critical.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, normal Starfleet channel has nothing but static. I'm getting something on another frequency, but it's not Starfleet.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm getting ground to air transmission.#
UHURA: Captain.#
UHURA: Frequency open, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, Mister Lindstrom from the surface.#
UHURA: Nothing, Captain. Hailing frequencies are open.#
UHURA: Captain, message coming in from Eminiar Seven. Sir, it's code seven-ten.#
UHURA: Positive. It repeats over and over.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, message coming in from the Captain.#
UHURA: A channel is open, Mister Ambassador. You will be speaking to Anan Seven, head of the High Council of the Eminian Union.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, it's Mister Spock.#
UHURA: Message from Eminiar Seven, Captain. Ambassador Fox reports negotiations underway with Vendikar. Outlook hopeful.#
UHURA: I'm picking up a signal, sir.  Captain, that's the old Morse code call signal.#
UHURA: CQ. CQ.#
UHURA: All decks acknowledging, sir.#
UHURA: Go ahead, boarding party. We read you.#
UHURA: Security alert, Captain. Communication channels are down, Captain.#
UHURA: All channels are totally jammed, Captain.#
UHURA: Record tapes engaged and ready, Captain.#
UHURA: Captain.#
UHURA: I've been transmitting a contact signal every five minutes. All I get is dead air. Shall I continue?#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I can't do that.#
UHURA: Oh, I know it is, Captain, but you see, all communications are out.#
UHURA: I short-circuited them, except ship to surface. We'll need that for a while. It's really for the best, Captain.#
UHURA: Automatic all-points relay from Starfleet Command, Captain, code one.#
UHURA: Captain. Unit XY-75847 report a fleet of Klingon ships in their sector, sir.#
UHURA: Unable to ascertain, sir.#
UHURA: Recording, sir.#
UHURA: Landing party to Enterprise. No sign of Doctor McCoy. Search progressing.#
UHURA: Captain, I've lost contact with the ship. I was talking to them. Suddenly, it went dead. No static, just nothing.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm frightened.#
UHURA: Captain, it seems impossible. Even if you were able to find the right date#
UHURA: Happiness at least, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, the Enterprise is up there. They're asking if we want to beam up.#
UHURA: No, sir. I've tried every major transmitting station on Deneva. None of them have acknowledged my contact signal.#
UHURA: But sir, that's a call sign for a private transmitter.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Making contact, Captain.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm having difficulty on that transmitter call to Deneva.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Captain. I've made contact with your private transmitter, sir.#
UHURA: Contact broken, sir.#
UHURA: Sorry, sir.#
UHURA: I'm afraid that's impossible at the moment, Captain. They stopped broadcasting immediately. They do not acknowledge my contact signal.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, receiving messages from a ground station.#
UHURA: The things are dying, sir. It's working.#
UHURA: Still no response, sir.#
UHURA: Contact established, Captain.#
UHURA: I'm sorry. I can't clear it, Captain.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, we are only registering on you.  Captain? Captain Kirk?#
UHURA: Mister DeSalle, that's exactly what happened to Mister Scott and his party. They, they just disappeared.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, are you all right? Where are you? Are the others all right, sir?#
UHURA: Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Come in, please. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Acknowledge. We've lost him again, Mister DeSalle.#
UHURA: I don't see any change.#
UHURA: Mister Scott. Computer central reports that we're coming up on the co-ordinates of the last established position of the shuttlecraft.#
UHURA: If the shuttlecraft powered away, Mister Scott, but if it were just towed?#
UHURA: What do you think it means, Mister Scott?#
UHURA: Well, I'd feel a lot better if it were a little more definite.#
UHURA: If there are no further traces, how are we going to follow them?#
UHURA: It's a big galaxy, Mister Scott.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, there are thousands of them out there they could be on, if they're on any of them at all.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, it's the Captain.#
UHURA: Call from the bridge, Captain.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, I'm getting a call from a vessel. It's so faint I can't make it out.#
UHURA: I've lost it. It sounded like a distress signal from an Earth vessel.#
UHURA: I have the signal clear now, Mister Scott. It is a distress call. It's from the SS Dierdre.#
UHURA: Reporting they're under attack. They're running, trying to manoeuvre. It's a Klingon vessel attacking.#
UHURA: Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Come in, Captain. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Come in, Captain.#
UHURA: Enterprise to Mister Spock. Doctor McCoy, come in please.#
UHURA: Scotty, the captain.#
UHURA: Negative, sir.#
UHURA: There's nothing, Mister Scott. All channels and frequencies are clear.#
UHURA: Or it could be an authentic distress call.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, another distress call from the USS Carolina.#
UHURA: The Carolina is registered in this sector.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: This is the USS Enterprise calling unidentified Klingon vessel. Come in. USS Enterprise calling Klingon vessel. Acknowledge, please.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Standing by, sir.#
UHURA: All cartographic standards full automatic.#
UHURA: It's almost as if it means to grab us.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Damage report coming in, Captain. Situation under control. Minor damage, stations three, seven, and nineteen.#
UHURA: Activity on hailing channel three, sir.#
UHURA: Calculated. Channel open, sir.#
UHURA: Mister Spock, I can't contact the landing party. All frequencies are jammed.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this.#
UHURA: I might be able to rig up a subspace bypass circuit.#
UHURA: I'm connecting the bypass circuit now, sir. It should take another half hour.#
UHURA: Mister Spock, I haven't done anything like this in years. If it isn't done just right, I could blow the entire communications system. It's very delicate work, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir. Right away.#
UHURA: I think we can try it now, sir. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Come in, Captain.#
UHURA: Captain, something's coming in on the Starfleet channel. Priority and urgent, sir.#
UHURA: Message complete, sir. Switching over.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Starfleet Command. Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Captain. We're standing by on Vulcan hailing frequencies, sir.#
UHURA: She's lovely, Mister Spock. Who is she?#
UHURA: Captain Kirk. Message from Starfleet Command, top priority.#
UHURA: Response to T'Pau's request for diversion of Enterprise to planet Vulcan#
UHURA: Nothing since their original distress call, sir.#
UHURA: There's nothing, sir. I'm scanning all frequencies.#
UHURA: First attack, sir?#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: I'm trying, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. All hailing frequencies open.#
UHURA: Captain, we're getting a signal from the spacecraft.#
UHURA: Yes, sir. It's impossible to get it any clearer, sir.#
UHURA: Analysis sector, channel one, main computer. Decode.#
UHURA: It's mathematical. Yes, one symbol. The symbol repeat. Sir, that isn't in the Starfleet code. It's an old-style interplanetary code.#
UHURA: It's another signal now, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, Captain.#
UHURA: Captain, the message is coming in now.#
UHURA: Doctor McCoy to the transporter room. Maintenance crew C5.#
UHURA: Mister Scott's engineers are working on them now. UHURA: Report to him when your indicators are registering properly.#
UHURA: Where my heart is, Where a scented miracle#
UHURA: Tomorrow the path along the way, There's where my love#
UHURA: What?#
UHURA: I don't know what it.  Oh, my singing. I was singing.#
UHURA: I don't know. I like to sing. I felt like music.#
UHURA: See the dog. See the dog,#
UHURA: R, r, run!#
UHURA: The dog has a, The dog,#
UHURA:  The dog has a ball.#
UHURA: All right, Christine.#
UHURA: The ball is bl-u-ee. Bl-u-ey. Bluey?#
UHURA: How did we get in these#
UHURA: Captain, what's happened?#
UHURA: Maybe what, Captain?#
UHURA: Yes.#
UHURA: Another Captain Kirk, another Doctor McCoy, another#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: You are away from your post, Mister.#
UHURA: No storm damage, sir. All stations report normal.  You're ordered to annihilate the Halkans unless they comply. No alternative.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, I have the leader on the Halkan Council waiting on channel B.#
UHURA: You aren't very persistent, Mister Sulu. The game has rules. You're ignoring them. I protest and you come back. You didn't come back.#
UHURA: I was getting bored. Of course this isn't the time.#
UHURA: I'm afraid I changed my mind. Again.#
UHURA:  So do you, Mister. So do you. Take over for me.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, all clear. On my way to Sickbay.#
UHURA: But, Captain, the Romulans have broken Code two. If you remember the last bulletin#
UHURA: Yes, sir. Code three.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: They are.#
UHURA: Those of Captain Kirk.#
UHURA: He did.#
UHURA: Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three.#
UHURA: Yes.#
UHURA: I think we just made contact, sir.#
UHURA: Engineering wants instructions, sir.#
UHURA: I'm trying, Commodore.#
UHURA: The Romulans are notorious for not listening to explanations.#
UHURA: Sir, I've tried all known hailing frequencies. They simply ignore us.#
UHURA: But, Captain, Code#
UHURA: Yes, Captain. Code two.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: I should say so.#
UHURA: How long does a body like that last?#
UHURA: Five hundred thousand years?#
UHURA: And it is a very pleasant place, Captain.#
UHURA: Oh, nothing really important. Just immortality.#
UHURA: No, they're lying. It's a trick. Doctor McCoy injected something into Harry Mudd to make him look sick. It's a trick to get back on board and sabotage the ship.#
UHURA: Because I want an android body. I want immortality. I'll live forever, Captain. I'll be young and beautiful.#
UHURA: Thank you.#
UHURA: I half believed it myself.#
UHURA: Thank you, kind sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. The channel's open, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. Transporter room, stand by.#
UHURA:  How often do I get shore leave?#
UHURA: What is it? Is it alive? May I hold it?#
UHURA: Oh, it's adorable. What is it?#
UHURA: A tribble?#
UHURA: Oh, it's purring. Listen, it's purring.#
UHURA: Are you selling them?#
UHURA: If you're not going to take him, I'm going to take him. I think he's cute.#
UHURA: All right, what are you selling them for?#
UHURA: Oh, I couldn't. Could I?#
UHURA: Captain, I have Mister Lurry.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Security, cancel Red Alert.#
UHURA: Since yesterday, Doctor. This morning, I found out that he, I mean she, had had babies.#
UHURA: Oh, Captain. Well, I hadn't intended to, sir, but the tribble had other plans.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Well, all right, Doctor, but if you're going to dissect it, I don't want to know about it.#
UHURA: Sure, why not? I think they're old enough.  Go ahead.#
UHURA: I don't know, sir. They do seem to be all over the ship.#
UHURA: But they do give us something, Mister Spock. They give us love. Well, Cyrano Jones says a tribble is the only love that money can buy.#
UHURA: Yes, Captain.#
UHURA: Aye, aye.#
UHURA: Aye.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, Captain.#
UHURA: Captain, both amplitude and frequency modulation being used. I think I can pick up something visual. It's a news broadcast using a system I think they once called video.#
UHURA: Aye.#
UHURA: Transmission lost, sir. Shall I try to get it back?#
UHURA: I'm afraid you have it all wrong, Mister Spock, all of you. I've been monitoring some of their old-style radio waves, the empire spokesman trying to ridicule their religion. But he couldn't. Don't you understand? It's not the sun up in the sky. It's the Son of God.#
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal translator. No response, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, Starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and confirms no authorised Federation vessel in this quadrant.#
UHURA: Captain? I picked up the last part of a transmission. Just like that other one. I put the recorder and the directional locator on it immediately.#
UHURA: Sir, the directional locator indicates reception point somewhere within the body of this ship.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: None, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm picking up the alien signal again, but it's coming from inside the Enterprise.#
UHURA: From the brig, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, the intercoms are jammed. All the ambassadors are asking what's going on.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Damage reports coming in, Captain. Every deck.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Make that definite, sir. They're sending a routine message to their home base with no mention of us.#
UHURA: Yellow Alert. All stations go to Yellow Alert.#
UHURA: Message to Starbase, sir?#
UHURA: On Earth, about twelve, sir.#
UHURA: We've seen different development at rates on different planets.#
UHURA: Or old-style hand lasers?#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: This is the craziest landing pad I've ever seen.#
UHURA: Captain. Look.#
UHURA: I don't think so, Captain.#
UHURA: They'll try, but where do they look? We're here, and we don't know where it is.#
UHURA: No!#
UHURA: I don't care whether it's allowed or not. I will not do it.#
UHURA: He's gone to report me. I said I didn't like the food.#
UHURA: Oh, Captain. Subspace message from Starfleet. They're inquiring#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, I have a report on Ensign Rizzo. He's dead, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, the Yorktown requesting information on how soon we expect to rendezvous with them.#
UHURA: There. It's coming, sir.#
UHURA: Frequency open and clear, sir.#
UHURA: Captain. There was a message from Starbase Six. Heavy interference. All I get is Intrepid and what sounded like a sector co-ordinate.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Enterprise calling Starbase Six. Enterprise calling Starbase Six. Come in. Come in.#
UHURA: Captain, I have Starbase Six readable now. Switching to audio, sir.#
UHURA: I cannot filter out the distortion, sir. It's getting worse.#
UHURA: Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock?#
UHURA: The telemetry probe, sir. There's no signal from it.#
UHURA: I'm just dizzy. I'll be all right. I'm fine, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Transmission to Starfleet complete, sir.#
UHURA: It's not coming from communications, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Contact lost, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm getting telemetry.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm receiving a message from Mister Spock on a low-energy channel. It's faint, but it is readable.#
UHURA: On audio, sir.#
UHURA: Damage control parties report minimal damage, sir. Repairs are being initiated.#
UHURA: Go ahead, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, I have received vocal contact from an official station. They relayed us to a man named Oxmyx. His title is Boss.#
UHURA: Mister Spock, what are you doing on this frequency?#
UHURA: Mister Spock, Mister Oxmyx is making contact from the surface.#
UHURA: Red Alert. All personnel, man your battle stations. Go to Red Alert.#
UHURA: Life support, come in.#
UHURA: All decks report. Damage and casualties.#
UHURA: I'll have a full report on ship's status for you in a moment, sir.#
UHURA: It's not a signal, sir. It does not seem to even exist, and yet it's affecting all my channels.#
UHURA: No, sir.#
UHURA: Over three weeks at this distance, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, no response on any Starfleet channel.#
UHURA: Nothing, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, no response from John Gill on any channel.#
UHURA: Doctor McCoy is having difficulty with that uniform, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, the station is calling us.#
UHURA: Priority message coming in, sir.#
UHURA: M-5 has acknowledged for us, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. Captain, M-5 has#
UHURA: Captain, message now coming in from Commodore Wesley.#
UHURA: Captain, there's no response to any of our signals, but M-5 has given us an autorelay.#
UHURA: Sir, sensors are picking up four Federation starships. M-5 is altering course to intercept.#
UHURA: Enterprise to USS Lexington. Come in, Lexington. Sir, I can't raise them. M-5 is blocking all frequencies, including automatic distress. Just a minute, sir. Captain, I'm getting audio signal from the Lexington.#
UHURA: Captain, M-5 is acknowledging.#
UHURA: Captain, visual contact with Lexington.#
UHURA: I'm sorry. I can't override M-5 interference.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm getting the Lexington again. Tapping in on their message to Starfleet Command, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, Lexington is receiving a message from Starfleet. They#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. All decks report ready, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Receiving no response to our signal, sir.#
UHURA: We'll beam it down shortly, Doctor.#
UHURA: Yes, sir. Captain Kirk informed us earlier you had survived.#
UHURA: Captain, are you all right now?#
UHURA: They're beginning to worry on Earth, Mister Scott.#
UHURA: Aye, aye.#
UHURA: No, Captain. It was Swahili.#
UHURA: Tied in, sir.#
UHURA: Nothing, sir. Clear on all frequencies.#
UHURA: Still no response, sir.#
UHURA: No damage, sir. All decks report fully operational.#
UHURA: What's the matter with them, Mister Spock?#
UHURA: I gave up my quarters because I#
UHURA: Captain Kirk. May I speak with you, sir?#
UHURA: A message just came from Starfleet Command. It was class-A security and scrambled. I put it through the decoder.#
UHURA: The Federation High Commissioner is on his way to Troyius to attend the royal wedding.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, no response from the Klingon vessel on any channel.#
UHURA: Bridge to Captain Kirk. Mister Spock, I'm getting#
UHURA: Bridge to Captain Kirk. Come in, please. Captain Kirk, please answer.#
UHURA: Oh, Captain, I'm picking up a transmission from inside the Enterprise. It's on a tight beam aimed at the Klingon vessel.#
UHURA: Captain, message from the Klingon ship. They're ordering us to stand by for boarding or be destroyed.#
UHURA: Frequency open, sir.#
UHURA: Captain. Message coming in.#
UHURA: Channel open, sir.#
UHURA: Hailing frequency open, sir.#
UHURA: Order?#
UHURA: There's been no order I know of, Mister Scott.#
UHURA: Battle stations. All hands, battle stations.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain Kirk, I'm receiving a class two signal from the Romulan vessel.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: The Romulan vessel is signalling again, sir.#
UHURA: Channel is open, Mister Scott, and you are tied in.#
UHURA: Doctor, you must beam aboard the Romulan flagship immediately. There's been an injury.#
UHURA: Doctor, it's Captain Kirk!#
UHURA: They said you'd been killed, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain Kirk. Mister Scott is on the intercom for you, sir.#
UHURA: Transporter room reports Mister Spock aboard, sir, and the Romulan commander.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. I have Sub-commander Tal, sir.#
UHURA: Everything is quiet, sir.#
UHURA:  Mister Sulu, the screen. We're out of orbit.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: I see my death. A long death. Disease and pain. I see my death.#
UHURA: Oh, God. Captain, don't let it be.#
UHURA: Hailing on all frequencies, sir. All languages have been attempted. No response. Now using standard interstellar symbols.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Security guard to the Bridge.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Deck five. Personnel, no damage.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: No signal at all, Captain.#
UHURA: Captain, I'm picking up high energy generation on planet six.#
UHURA: It could be natural. Volcanic activity, steam, any number of causes. But it's very regular.#
UHURA: What would they want with his brain? What would they want with Mister Spock's brain? What use is it?#
UHURA: Why do they want it?#
UHURA: Yes, sir. It doesn't make sense, but it's there.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Channel open, sir.#
UHURA: They don't answer, Captain.#
UHURA: Captain, I have engineering now.#
UHURA: I've been trying to raise them, sir. There is no response.#
UHURA: Mister Spock? We will be able to retrieve the Captain at that time, won't we?#
UHURA: I see.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Doctor, he seemed more angry than frightened.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. Red Alert. All decks, go to Red Alert.#
UHURA: Mister Spock? I'm receiving a visual signal.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Mister Spock, damage control report. Minor structural damage to sections A4 and C13.#
UHURA: Mister Spock!#
UHURA: There's no response on any frequency, sir.#
UHURA: They're refusing reception. I can't#
UHURA: What is that?#
UHURA: Captain! Captain Kirk, we thought you were#
UHURA: Spock! Mister. Oh, Doctor I've just seen the Captain.#
UHURA: He's alive. He's alive, Doctor.#
UHURA: Believe me, I did see him. I did. Spock! Mister Spock!#
UHURA: Doctor. Doctor, I'm not going mad. I did see Captain Kirk. I've got to get to Mister Spock.#
UHURA: Mister Spock didn't believe me either, did he, Doctor?#
UHURA: Then I didn't really see him, did I?#
UHURA: Will I become like Chekov, Doctor?#
UHURA: Am I all right, Doctor?#
UHURA: Captain Kirk's alive?#
UHURA: Thank you, sir.#
UHURA: I see him.#
UHURA: Where are we now, Mister Spock?#
UHURA: Have we lost the Captain?#
UHURA: No, sir. All bands clear.#
UHURA: Still no contact with Starfleet Command, sir. Outside communications blanketed.#
UHURA: No contact with Starfleet as yet, sir.#
UHURA:  Captain! This doesn't make sense. Carriers are normal. Channels are open. There's still no outside contact! I don't understand it, sir. Could the Klingons be doing something?#
UHURA: Captain, reports coming in from the lower decks. Emergency bulkheads have closed. Almost four hundred crewmen are trapped down there, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, why would, why would Chekov believe he has a brother?#
UHURA: Sickbay calling, Doctor. There are more wounded men requiring your attention.#
UHURA: We were forced in the transporter and beamed down. It was like becoming someone's puppet.#
UHURA:  I'm so frightened, Captain. I'm so very frightened.#
UHURA: I know it, but I wish I could stop trembling.#
UHURA: I'm thinking. I'm thinking of all the times on the Enterprise when I was scared to death and I would see you so busy at your commands. And I would hear your voice from all the parts of the ship and my fears would fade. And now they are making me tremble. But I'm not afraid. I am not afraid.#
UHURA: Yes, sir. I am still receiving visual contact. I can see them, but I can't see you.#
UHURA: Co-ordinates correspond, Captain.#
UHURA: Malfunction, sir.#
UHURA: Captain. It corrected itself.#
UHURA: The tape is ready, sir.#
UHURA: That would explain our continuing to receive it while our sensors only picked up the landing party, sir.#
UHURA: Captain. Captain Kirk! He's gone!#
UHURA: Well, he was sitting there. He'd just drunk his coffee and set his cup down. You see it's still there. And then he vanished.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir.#
UHURA: I'm sorry, sir. I touched the tape button accidentally. I'll take it off.#
UHURA: No, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Mister Spock! Are you all right?#
UHURA: What happened?#
UHURA: No, Mister Spock. I meant what happened to us?#
UHURA: Damage control report. Ship functioning normally. Many bumps and bruises. One casualty, Mister Spock. The transporter officer, he's dead.#
UHURA: Security sweeps of all decks are negative, Mister Spock. No evidence of intruder.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. All decks, cancel Red Alert. Maintain increased security.#
UHURA: How did she get off the ship, sir?#
UHURA: Yes, sir. Mister Spock what are the chances of the captain and the others being alive?#
UHURA: Yes, Mister Spock.#
UHURA: Oh yes, sir.#
UHURA: Magnetic force indicator jumping, Mister Spock.#
UHURA: Magnetic force has dropped to normal, sir.#
UHURA: Magnetic forces steady.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, Captain. No response, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir. Hailing on all frequencies.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Captain, I've tried all hailing frequencies. Negative, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Starfleet Command extends greetings to Commissioner Bele of the planet Cheron. His urgent request to be transported to his planet with the man he claims prisoner has been taken under consideration.#
UHURA: Ready, Mister Scott.#
UHURA: Ariannus says go ahead.#
UHURA: It just seemed to go dead, sir.#
UHURA: Shall I alert security, sir?#
UHURA: Captain, someone has activated the transporter mechanism.#
UHURA: Captain, the transporter mechanism has been activated again.#
UHURA: It doesn't make any sense.#
UHURA: Do you suppose that's all they ever had, sir?#
UHURA: Aye, sir. There's no response, Mister Scott.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: No, Mister Scott. Still no response from the planet.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, it's the captain.#
UHURA:  Life continues to exist on the planet.#
UHURA: Yes, Mister Spock.#
UHURA: Yes, Mister Spock. They have provided us with the co-ordinates for beam down.#
UHURA: Gideon is contacting us, Mister Spock.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, Mister Spock.#
UHURA: At once, sir.#
UHURA: There has been no response as yet, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir. They insist that the matter must be referred to the Federation.#
UHURA: Bureau of Planetary Treaties.#
UHURA: I did, Mister Spock. They insist that we must go through Starfleet channels.#
UHURA: The ambassador will speak, sir. They're requesting visual communication.#
UHURA: Yes, he's infuriating, sir. How can you stand it?#
UHURA: Yes, Mister Spock. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise to Starfleet Command.#
UHURA: Eight seven five, zero two zero, zero seven nine.#
UHURA: Condition yellow, sir.#
UHURA: Yes, sir. All stations are operative, sir.#
UHURA: Captain. During the disturbance, Memory Alpha was hailing. I wanted to respond, but I couldn't make my hand move.#
UHURA: Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid. I'm hailing on all frequencies. No response.#
UHURA: I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: All channels open. Translator tied in.#
UHURA: Captain, the High Advisor of Ardana is ready to receive you on Stratos, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: Aye, sir.#
UHURA: There is no report on Mister Flint. He doesn't seem to have any past.#
UHURA: I've repeatedly tried on every hailing frequency, sir. There's no response on any channel.#
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.#
UHURA: Excuse me, Captain Kirk.#
UHURA: Mister Scott#
UHURA: But why should I object to that term, sir? You see, in our century we've learned not to fear words.#
UHURA: Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two hours.#
UHURA: All decks report status. All decks report status.#
UHURA: No damage report, Mister Scott.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, I have the captain.#
UHURA: Mister Scott, I have the captain.#
UHURA: Red Alert, Captain. Mister Scott is standing by.#
UHURA: I don't know yet, sir.#
UHURA: Captain Kirk, the planet has resumed its normal appearance.#
