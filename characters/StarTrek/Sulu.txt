SULU: Astro sciences standing by, Captain.#
SULU: If you want the mathematics of this, Mitchell's ability is increasing geometrically. That is, like having a penny, doubling it every day. In a month, you'll be a millionaire.#
SULU: Sir, contact with an object. It's moving toward us. No visual contact yet.#
SULU: It's coming at light speed.#
SULU: Object changing direction, too, sir. Keeps coming at us.#
SULU: It's slowing down, Mister Spock.#
SULU: Bridge to all decks. Condition alert. All decks, condition alert. Captain Kirk to the Bridge. Captain's Log, star date 1512.2. On our third day of star mapping, an unexplained cubical object blocked our vessel's path. On the Bridge, Mister Spock immediately ordered general alert. My location, Sickbay. Quarterly physical check.#
SULU: You try to cross brains with Spock, he'll cut you to pieces every time.#
SULU: Each of its edges measures one hundred seven metres. Mass, a little under eleven thousand metric tons.#
SULU: Yes, sir. Helmsman to Engine Room, stand by. All decks alert. We're going to try pulling away.#
SULU: Point two five, sir. Still blocking us, sir.#
SULU: Point five oh, sir.#
SULU: Half speed.#
SULU: Full speed.#
SULU: Warp one, sir.#
SULU: Warp two, sir. Speed is now warp three.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: There, sir.#
SULU: Reducing to warp two, sir.#
SULU: Engines overloading, sir.#
SULU: All engines stopped, sir.#
SULU: Magnification two five, sir. Magnification one eight point five, sir.#
SULU: Plotted and laid in, sir.#
SULU: Warp factor. There's no response.#
SULU: All engine systems show dead, and weapon systems.#
SULU: Seven minutes and forty five seconds.#
SULU: Four minutes, thirty seconds.#
SULU: One minute. I knew he would.  If anyone's interested, thirty seconds.#
SULU: Eleven, ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.#
SULU: Something's going on, Captain.#
SULU: We're being towed, sir. Captain's Log, star date 1514.1. The Enterprise is in tow. To this point, no resistance has been offered. My plan? A show of resignation. Balok's tractor beam has to be a heavy drain of power on his small ship. Question. Will he grow careless?#
SULU: Our speed is down to point six four of light.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: It's a strain, Captain. Engines are overloading.#
SULU: All engines stopped, sir.#
SULU: Ahead slow, sir.#
SULU: There he is, sir. Centre screen. Still trying to run away from us, sir.#
SULU: No, sir.#
SULU: Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.#
SULU: He's seen the asteroids too, sir.#
SULU: If one hits him.#
SULU: He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain.#
SULU: We're overloading, Captain. Engine temperatures climbing.#
SULU: That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir.#
SULU: Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing with battery power, sir.#
SULU: Asteroid hit him dead centre.#
SULU: You're on duty, Johnny-o. Back to reality.#
SULU: I noticed. How I noticed. Come on, Johnny.#
SULU: Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support system is now on batteries.#
SULU: Power curve still dropping, Captain.#
SULU: Checking, but not getting much.#
SULU: That's Ben Childress' quarters.#
SULU: Engines engaged. Helm answering.#
SULU: Ahead full, sir.#
SULU:  Temperature's starting to drop.#
SULU: That's nippy.;#
SULU: It's already twenty degrees below zero. Can't exactly#
SULU: Can you give us a status report, Captain? Temperature's still dropping. Now forty one degrees below zero.#
SULU: Do you think you might be able to find a long rope somewhere and lower us down a pot of hot coffee?#
SULU:  I think we ought to give room service another call. That coffee's taking too long. Enterprise, this is Sulu.#
SULU: Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up. We're using hand phasers to heat the rocks. One phaser quit on us, three still operating. Any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here?#
SULU: Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here. One hundred seventeen below. Can't last much longer.#
SULU: In here feeding the weepers, Janice.#
SULU: May the Great Bird of the Galaxy bless your planet.#
SULU: Her name's Gertrude.#
SULU: Why do people have to call inanimate objects she, like she's a fast ship.#
SULU: Hello, Green.#
SULU:  Take it easy. Calm down. Very sensitive.#
SULU: Wait a minute, I'll walk along.#
SULU: Bridge. Sulu. Trouble on deck nine, section two. We need a medical team.#
SULU: GQ three now secured except for decks five, seven, and ten. Come in, please.#
SULU: Go to Engineering now. Run through file photos of the crewmen there.#
SULU: Keep in mind if you find him, he's not Crewman Green. The Captain reports Crewman Green is dead.#
SULU: He, whatever, was probably your crewman, too, Lieutenant.#
SULU: The creature?#
SULU: Ready to leave orbit, Captain.#
SULU: Warp one, sir. Leaving orbit.#
SULU: Foil. It's a rapier. A thin sword.#
SULU: What do you mean, what do you do with it?#
SULU: You practice.#
SULU: Hi, Joey.#
SULU: Your attitude is all wrong. Fencing tones the muscle, sharpens the eye, improves the posture. You tell him, Joey. Explain to him. Hey, Joey. You feeling all right?#
SULU: What's with him?#
SULU: You sure you're all right now, Joe? We've got to leave.#
SULU: Take it easy, Joe.#
SULU: Now calm down.#
SULU: You're all steamed up, Joe.#
SULU: What are you doing, Joe?#
SULU: Joey, don't be a fool.#
SULU: Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir. Planet continuing to shrink in mass.#
SULU: Helm answering nicely, Captain.#
SULU: Relative gravity increase, sir. Like the planet reached out and yanked at us.#
SULU: Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe. I'm sweating like a bridegroom.#
SULU: Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad?#
SULU: Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.#
SULU:  Richelieu, beware! Stand. No farther. No escape for you. You either leave this bois bloodied, or with my blood on your swords. Cowards!#
SULU: Richelieu, at last.#
SULU: For honour, Queen, and France!#
SULU: Ah.#
SULU: I'll protect you, fair maiden.#
SULU: Foul Richelieu. (distracted by Uhura's escape, Kirk is able to grab Sulu and Spock does a neck-pinch)#
SULU:  I was on the Bridge. Hey Doc, what am I doing here?#
SULU: Doc, will you let me out of here? I'm all right.#
SULU: Course laid in, sir.#
SULU: Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale.#
SULU: My chronometer's running backwards, sir.#
SULU: Helm answering, sir. Power reversing.#
SULU: Warp one, sir.#
SULU: Course laid in, sir.#
SULU: Our speed is now maximum, sir.#
SULU: Battle stations. All hands to battle stations. Battle stations. Battle stations. All decks acknowledge. All decks acknowledge, sir. All stations show green.#
SULU: Screen is on full mag, sir.#
SULU: Acknowledged, sir.#
SULU: Cancel battle stations.#
SULU: I agree, sir. Respectfully recommend all decks maintain security alert.#
SULU: Security alert, sir.#
SULU: Something visual ahead, Captain, at extreme range. He's changing course, sir.#
SULU: Turning, sir.#
SULU: They're turning, sir. We're staying with them.#
SULU: Attack, without a visible target? How do we aim our phasers?#
SULU: And hope for a lucky shot before they zero in on us?#
SULU: And if they could report they destroyed us?#
SULU: All stations manned, Captain.#
SULU: Acknowledged, Captain.#
SULU: Phaser crew signal ready, sir.#
SULU: Sir, nothing in#
SULU: Hard to starboard.#
SULU: Phaser overload. Control circuit burnout.#
SULU: Captain, are they surrendering?#
SULU: Full power, sir. It's still overtaking us. If we can get one phaser working, sir, one shot might detonate it.#
SULU: Ten seconds to impact. Captain, It's dissipating, sir.#
SULU: Five, four, three, two, one. Impact!#
SULU: Ahead, sir. Maximum.#
SULU: Debris scatter ahead, sir. We've hit him.#
SULU: Lateral power, sir.#
SULU: More wreckage, sir, scattering across our path.#
SULU: Enemy vessel becoming visible, sir.#
SULU: Scanners are blank, Captain. We're getting a mass of readings I've never seen. Nothing makes sense.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Yes, Captain?#
SULU: Totally inoperative, sir. No readings at all.#
SULU: Yes, sir. No change.#
SULU: But Captain, two degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Captain, course set for Makus Three.#
SULU: Space normal, sir?#
SULU: Captain, there's something there on screen, at Taurus Two. (On the viewscreen, a long trail of yellow crosses the green of the planet)#
SULU: No. It's holding a lateral line. There it is again. Holding steady, Captain.#
SULU: Whatever it was, Captain, it just burned up in the atmosphere.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor one.#
SULU: Beautiful, beautiful. No animals, no people, no worries. Just what the doctor ordered. Right, Doctor?#
SULU: Do you think the Captain will authorise shore leave here?#
SULU: He'd like it.#
SULU: To get some cell-structure records. A blade of grass, a bush, a tree, a flower petal. With these, we can tell the whole planet's biology. (As Sulu crouches down behind some pampas grass, McCoy turns and looks straight at a white rabbit in a check jacket, yellow waistcoat, and looking at a gold pocket-watch.)#
SULU: What is it? What's the matter?#
SULU: See what? I don't see anything. What is it, Doc?#
SULU: Target shooting, Captain. Isn't it a beauty? Haven't got anything like this in my collection.#
SULU: I found it. I know it's a crazy coincidence, but I've always wanted one like this. Found it lying right over there. An old-time police special, and in beautiful condition. Hasn't been one like this made in a couple of centuries.#
SULU:  It fires lead pellets propelled by expanding gases from a chemical explosion.#
SULU: Captain, take cover! There's a Samurai after me.#
SULU: I mean, there was.  Captain, you've got to believe me.#
SULU: Got a call a few minutes ago. Rodriguez. Said you were rendezvousing back at the glade.#
SULU: That's not all. So's my phaser.#
SULU: Yes, sir.  Look. Someone beaming down from the bridge.#
SULU: We're stranded down here, Captain?#
SULU:  Captain! Captain!#
SULU: You'd better have a look at this, sir. (the knight is a plastic dummy) I don't understand.#
SULU: It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive.#
SULU: Still operating, sir.#
SULU: Captain!#
SULU: He's gone. Dragged off.#
SULU: Sir.#
SULU: Play? As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play?#
SULU: Forty degrees. (He reaches for the switch, and sways as if dizzy, then stands up and vanishes)#
SULU: Where are we?#
SULU: Is he kidding?#
SULU: Captain, where could he possibly come from? Who is this maniac?#
SULU: You mean, it shows he's dead?#
SULU: No.#
SULU: We haven't even got our phasers.#
SULU: Captain, how far do we go along with this charade?#
SULU: Laid in, sir.#
SULU: Standing by to warp, sir.#
SULU: Captain, we're about to warp.#
SULU: No, sir. All instruments show on course.#
SULU: Turning, Captain. Nut not veering off from it.#
SULU: Turn completed, and still accelerating toward the planet.#
SULU: Warping down, Captain. Our warp factor four.#
SULU: Captain, we're coming under attack. Unidentified ship quartering in.#
SULU: Firing phasers, Captain. The alien has screens up, too.#
SULU: Are you under attack, Captain?#
SULU: Captain, are you all right?#
SULU: We returned fire with all phaser banks. Negative against its deflector screen.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Arm photon torpedoes. Stand by.#
SULU: We can't get visual contact. She's too far away.#
SULU: Photon torpedoes locked on, Captain.#
SULU: All banks fired, sir.#
SULU: Clear, Captain, but you#
SULU: Yes, sir. Photon torpedoes negative, Captain. I'm warping out of orbit.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Our screens are down. We can beam you up now, sir.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Captain's log, supplement. We have beamed back to the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel. It appears to be headed toward a largely unexplored section of the galaxy.#
SULU: They must be aware we're after them, sir. They've gone to warp six also.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Alien ship maintaining interval, Captain. Now at warp seven.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Captain.#
SULU: Closing on target, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir. We're closing, sir.#
SULU: Captain!#
SULU: The alien. It's slowing down. Warp five, four, two. It's going sublight, sir. Sir? It's stopped dead in space.#
SULU: No, sir. They're just dead out there.#
SULU: Yes, sir. Unmoving.#
SULU: Range is one eight one zero. One seven six zero. Range is one seven zero zero. One six four zero. Range is one five nine zero. One five five zero and closing, sir. (Suddenly, the ship decelerates, and everyone hangs on to something as the lights dim.) SULU: Warp six, warp five, four, warp three, warp one. Sublight, Captain. We're stuck, Captain. It's impossible, but. It's impossible.#
SULU: He's gone.#
SULU: Captain.#
SULU: It's impossible, but there's Sirius over there when it should be here. And Canopus. And Arcanis. We're. All of a sudden, we're clear across the galaxy, five hundred parsecs from where we are I mean, were. I mean#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Warp factor one.#
SULU: Yes, sir. Helm answering. She's sluggish, sir.#
SULU: Picking up, sir, but she's still slow in responding.#
SULU: Me, too. If this one's like those, it'll make the devil's noise if you start it.#
SULU: I didn't hear anything.#
SULU: The emergency signal.#
SULU: Five thirty in that time zone, maybe a little after.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Shall I issue phasers?#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Mister Spock ran them through. They were the right ones. We got them all.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir. Captain's Log, Stardate 3114.1. We must make an attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers will remain its prisoners. All we have is a theory and a few facts.#
SULU: Warp factor three, sir.#
SULU: Sir, our speed is increasing. We're travelling at over warp eight.#
SULU: It's maximum now, sir. She's fighting it.#
SULU: Gaining speed now, Captain. We're now at warp four, warp seven. Eight. Off the dial, sir.#
SULU: Past Pluto, sir.#
SULU: Engines cutting back, sir. No decrease in speed.#
SULU: The engines!#
SULU: O'Neil, we've got to keep going. Come on, get up.#
SULU: The Captain gave us an order. We've got to find some clue.#
SULU: Scouting party to Enterprise.#
SULU: Captain, beam us up quick. Emergency.#
SULU: Mister O'Neil, stand tight. They'll beam us up any minute.#
SULU: O'Neil! (One of the robed figures reaches Sulu and points his hollow stave at him. Sulu stiffens, then relaxes with a smile on his face. The transporter takes him away.)#
SULU: What? Who?#
SULU: You. You're not of the Body.#
SULU: You, you did it. They knew we were Archons. These are the clothes they wear, not these.#
SULU: Landru. Landru.#
SULU: They're wonderful. They're the sweetest, friendliest people in the universe. It's paradise, my friend. Paradise.#
SULU: Paradise. Paradise. Captain's Log. Stardate 3156.2. While orbiting planet Beta Three trying to find some trace of the starship Archon that disappeared here a hundred years ago, a search party consisting of two Enterprise officers were sent to the planet below. Mister Sulu has returned, but in a highly agitated mental state. His condition requires I beam down with an additional search detail.#
SULU: Relieving you.#
SULU: Is it possible that they're not?#
SULU: Whatever doesn't look right, whatever that is. When it comes to farms, I wouldn't know what looked right or wrong if it were two feet from me.#
SULU: What is it?#
SULU: Come to think of it, we haven't seen any animals. No horses, no pigs, not even a dog. Nothing.#
SULU: Captain, we've checked out everything. It all seems normal, except for the absence of any animals.#
SULU: We haven't seen them since we began our check.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Yes, I see now. Of course we can't remove the colony. It'd be wrong.#
SULU: Sorry, DeSalle.#
SULU: I said I was sorry.#
SULU: If you hadn't gotten in my way#
SULU: Captain, the automatic deflector screen just popped on. Body approaching.#
SULU: Captain, the other ship doesn't register. Only drifting debris. We got him.#
SULU: No contact, Captain. He blew up all right.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Perfectly, sir.#
SULU: We'll handle them, sir.#
SULU: But, Captain#
SULU: Captain, a large number of Klingon vessels have just arrived.#
SULU: They're opening fire.#
SULU: Yes, sir. My screens are up. I can't drop them to beam you aboard.#
SULU: Captain.#
SULU: I can't explain it. We were just closing in on the Klingon fleet when#
SULU: We're holding orbit, sir. The helm is sluggish.#
SULU: Captain, we're picking up a ship on our sensors, heading directly into the Denevan sun. He'll burn up.#
SULU: He's too close, Captain.#
SULU: He burned up, Captain.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Completing the seeding orbit, Captain. Two hundred and ten ultraviolet satellites now in position. Seventy two miles altitude, permanent orbit about the planet.#
SULU: Ready, Captain.#
SULU: Warp factor one, sir.#
SULU: Steady. No, Mister Scott, bearing three ten mark thirty five just cleared. No antimatter residue.#
SULU: Bearing two ten mark forty. Strong particle concentration. We're on it, Mister Scott.#
SULU: Course laid in, sir. Particle density decreasing. Gone, sir. No readings.#
SULU: Approaching what seems to be an asteroid belt, sir. Scanners report approximately seven thousand bodies of sizes running from types A to N.#
SULU: Approximately thirty four percent of the bodies of atmospherian types H to M.#
SULU: Course two twenty four mark twelve. ETA fifty seven minutes.#
SULU: You think it's a Klingon ship?#
SULU: Picking it up, sir. Taking a fix.#
SULU: Interception course computed and laid in, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Approaching the freighter's last reported position, sir.#
SULU: At best, a freighter might travel warp two.#
SULU: It couldn't have run away from us, sir. Not a freighter.#
SULU: Wouldn't they normally call for the nearest starship?#
SULU: A trap. We were diverted from the planet.#
SULU: Yes, sir. Continuing.#
SULU: Still negative, Mister Scott. All sweeps.#
SULU: Warp five, sir. On course for Capella Four.#
SULU: Scotty, if it should turn out to be real#
SULU: Thirty one minutes, sir.#
SULU: Reversing to sub-light, one half.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: I have it on the viewscreen now, sir. Still distant. Holding a position dead ahead, sir.#
SULU: Still closing. The alien's directly in our line of flight.#
SULU: Phaser banks are ready, sir.#
SULU: Captain?#
SULU: Not unless I am, too. Captain, that thing's a giant hand.#
SULU: Hard about. We can't seem to get away from it.#
SULU: All engines reverse. (Everyone is thrown forward as the ship is grabbed by the hand and stopped in its tracks.) SULU: We're dead still, Captain. Helm doesn't answer. We can't move. Captain's log, stardate 3468.1. While approaching Pollux Four, a planet in the Beta Geminorum system, the Enterprise has been stopped in space by an unknown force of some kind.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Applying thrust, sir. No results, Captain. We're stuck tight.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Standing by.#
SULU: Ineffective, Captain. There doesn't seem to be anything to push against.#
SULU: Working, sir.#
SULU: Computed and standing by to generate, sir.#
SULU: No good, Mister Spock. We didn't even faze it. We're still locked tight.#
SULU: Mister Spock, here's something. There seems to be a radiated energy pulsation coming from the planet. I don't know what it is, sir.#
SULU: I can't seem to pinpoint it.#
SULU: The whole planet, sir? Yes, sir. The whole planet.#
SULU: Sectors one through twenty five charted and examined. No chance at all of power originating in those areas.#
SULU: Aye, sir. Fourteen B by twenty six index.#
SULU: All phaser banks, fire!#
SULU: All phaser banks, maintain firing rate!#
SULU: Maintaining, sir.#
SULU: How do you figure it, Chekov? First we're going to Vulcan, then we're going to Altair, then we're headed to Vulcan again, and now we're headed back to Altair.#
SULU: Maybe you ought to plot a course back for Vulcan, just in case.#
SULU: Sir, we're now within the limits of System L-370, but I can't seem to locate#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Entering limits of System L-374, sir. Scanners show the same evidence of destruction.#
SULU: All phaser banks manned and ready, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: No other vessels in the area, Captain. All scanners show clear.#
SULU: It's closing on us, Mister Spock.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: It's veering off, back on course for the next solar system. The Rigel colony, sir.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. (Spock stands completely still, like a statue, as Enterprise arrives back at the planet-killer.)#
SULU: Closing fast.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Direct hit. It just bounced off.#
SULU: We can't break loose! SPOCK; We need more power. SULU: We haven't got it. We're being pulled inside.#
SULU: Aye, sir. We still can't move.#
SULU: We're loose, Commodore.#
SULU: Standing by, sir.#
SULU: We're moving away, Commodore.#
SULU: It's closing with us again, sir.#
SULU: It's sucking in space rubble from those destroyed planets. Refueling itself.#
SULU: It's gaining on us, sir.#
SULU: Mark twenty one, sir.#
SULU: Mister Spock, someone's opening the shuttlecraft bay doors.#
SULU: It's too late, sir.#
SULU: Mister Spock, sensors indicate a minute drop in the machine's power emanations. Do you think the shuttlecraft explosion might have done some damage?#
SULU: He's two thousand miles from the planet killer and closing fast.#
SULU: Fifteen hundred miles and closing.#
SULU: One thousand miles and closing.#
SULU: Five hundred miles and closing.#
SULU: Sixty, fifty, forty#
SULU: Ten#
SULU: Captain, the life-support system override jammed.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: This is the first time I heard a malfunction threaten us.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: What's going on, Captain?#
SULU: Captain?  Who ever he is, he sure talks gloomy.#
SULU: With an armful of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a supernova.#
SULU: I wonder who it is we're not supposed to be afraid of.#
SULU: Captain, shields just snapped on. Something heading in at multiwarp speeds.#
SULU: It's going to hit. (Everyone gets thrown around a lot, and the lights go out for a short while.)#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: We're losing power, sir.#
SULU: Photon torpedoes armed, sir.#
SULU: Ready, sir.#
SULU: Torpedo away.  Direct hit.#
SULU: Sir, they've fired another.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Mister Chekov, phaser setting for planetary target A.#
SULU: Port batteries locked. (Uhura enters, and goes to her station. Sulu goes over to her. He has a very nasty scar down his face.) SULU: Still no interest, Uhura? Hmm? I could change your mind.#
SULU: Is the captain here? Is Spock here? When the cat's away#
SULU: Phasers Locked on target A, Captain. Approaching optimum range. Commence fire, Captain? Captain?#
SULU: Shall I correct orbit to new firing position?#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Secondary target now moving beyond our phaser lock.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: My security board has detected extensive use of computer, Mister Spock. I was about to inform you.#
SULU: He's working on escape or defence.#
SULU: Correct. It's your play. I hope you succeed, because the order would fall on me next and you know how Captain Kirk's enemies have a habit of disappearing.#
SULU:  Now you're making sense.#
SULU: Any time's a good time.#
SULU: You take a lot of chances, Lieutenant.#
SULU: Mister Spock has orders to kill you, Captain. He will succeed, apparently. You will also appear to have killed him after a fierce battle. Regrettable, but it will leave me in command. (Then one of the henchmen disappears, and another. Marlena presses the button again and Sulu is alone. Kirk disarms and knocks him out easily.)#
SULU: Standard orbit, Captain.#
SULU: You already gave that command, sir.#
SULU: You'll live.#
SULU: Maintaining standard orbit, Captain.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: You mean another twenty thousand, Captain?#
SULU: Orbiting at twenty thousand, sir.#
SULU: Maintaining, sir.#
SULU: Two years, sir.#
SULU: No, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order.#
SULU: Across the Neutral Zone?#
SULU: Entering Romulan Neutral Zone, sir. All sensors on maximum.#
SULU: Romulans approaching from both sides. We're bracketed, sir.#
SULU: Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir. We've tangled with them before.#
SULU: Sir, they've fired another.#
SULU: They know they have us. They know our shields will give out.#
SULU: We're losing power, sir.#
SULU: We're surrounded by Romulan vessels. Maximum of ten. Range fifty to a hundred thousand kilometres.#
SULU: Standing by, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir. And out of the Neutral Zone.#
SULU: Two five seven degrees, mark three.#
SULU: Steady as she goes, Captain.#
SULU: There's an unplanned course change being fed into the instruments, sir.#
SULU: I can't, sir.#
SULU: Sir, auxiliary control is on total override.#
SULU: Turning on three oh seven degrees, mark eight. Being executed now, sir.#
SULU: Sir, the instruments won't respond.#
SULU: Sir, we're picking up speed. Warp five, six. Warp seven, sir.#
SULU: I can't, sir. All the controls are jammed.#
SULU: Planet dead ahead, Captain. Becoming visual.#
SULU: All power gone, sir.#
SULU: All normal. No damage at all.#
SULU: Standard orbit, Captain.#
SULU: We're coming back on our original course, Captain.#
SULU: Captain, the M-5 has calculated that. The orbit is already plotted.#
SULU: Standard orbit achieved, Captain.#
SULU: Phasers one one hundredth power, sir.#
SULU: Speed increasing to warp three. Turning now to one one two mark five. Phasers locking on target, sir.#
SULU: Main phasers firing. A hit, sir. Two more.#
SULU: Phasers firing again.#
SULU: Firing again.#
SULU: Captain, deflector shields just came on.#
SULU: She won't respond, sir. She's maintaining course.#
SULU: I already tried, sir.#
SULU: Right away, sir. You heard him.#
SULU: Captain, helm doesn't respond. Navigational controls still locked in by M-5.#
SULU: Phasers locking on lead ship, sir. Power levels at full strength.#
SULU: Our phasers are firing, sir.#
SULU: We're firing again, sir.#
SULU: Phasers firing, Captain.#
SULU: Phasers locked on.#
SULU: Phasers firing.#
SULU: Phasers firing. A hit.#
SULU: The other three ships are holding station out of range. The Excalibur looks dead.#
SULU: All phaser power gone, sir.#
SULU: It's the USS Exeter, sir.#
SULU: The sensors indicate no damage to the vessel, Captain.#
SULU: Sir, this is Lieutenant Sulu in temporary command of the Enterprise.#
SULU: Captain, this is Sulu. We read you, but surely you know that can't be done#
SULU: Captain, we have volunteers standing by to beam down. What is your situation?#
SULU: Sir, we picked up communicator signals, but#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Computers indicate an impact somewhere in the heart of the Euro-Asian continent.#
SULU: Impulse drive, Captain?#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Lost contact now.#
SULU: Captain! Distant bearing, sir, mark seven three point five.#
SULU: Phasers ready, sir.#
SULU: Laid in, Captain.#
SULU: Aye, sir. One hundred thousand kilometres. Ninety. Eighty.#
SULU: Sixty.#
SULU: Fifty.#
SULU: She's passed us without firing a shot.#
SULU: Captain, the Klingon ship is closing on an intercept course. Five hundred thousand kilometres. Deflector shields up.#
SULU: Three hundred thousand kilometres.#
SULU: One hundred thousand kilometres.#
SULU: Here he comes again, sir.#
SULU: Sorry, Captain. She won't respond fast enough on impulse.#
SULU: He's paralleling us again. He seems to have broken off the attack.#
SULU: He's coming in again, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Shields holding, but weakened, sir.#
SULU: Captain, number four shield just collapsed. Impulse power down to thirty one percent.#
SULU: Captain, he's starting his run.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Warp power to the shields, Captain?#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: One hundred thousand kilometres.#
SULU: Seventy five. Seventy. Sixty. Fifty.#
SULU: Forty.#
SULU: Thirty.#
SULU: Direct hit amidships by photon torpedo.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Not enough, Mister Spock. It's only point zero zero one three degrees.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: All phasers locked, sir.#
SULU: Standing by, sir.#
SULU: Phaser one firing.#
SULU: Phaser four firing. All phasers fired, sir.#
SULU: Maintaining course and speed, sir.#
SULU: But, sir, that'll lead us directly into the Romulan Neutral Zone.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Captain, leaving Neutral Zone. Now entering Romulan space.#
SULU: Captain!#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Holding at warp nine, sir.#
SULU: Three one eight mark seven, sir. Executing.#
SULU: Maintaining standard orbit, Captain.#
SULU: Hi there.#
SULU:  The planet Triacus.#
SULU: With all respects, Captain, you're wrong. I have Triacus on my screen now.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Captain, stay away from the controls! If you touch them, we'll be destroyed.#
SULU: Marcos Twelve dead ahead, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Course reversed, Captain.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Phaser banks standing by, sir.#
SULU: What happened?#
SULU: No change from last reading, sir.#
SULU: I've got it again. An ion trail matching when we first saw her.#
SULU: Warp six.#
SULU: No mistake, sir. Captain's log, stardate 5431.4. for fifteen hours and twenty minutes we have been following the ion trail of the spaceship that has Spock's brain. Time left to us, eight hours and forty minutes.#
SULU: Captain, I've lost the trail.#
SULU: It's gone, sir. A sudden deaction shift.#
SULU: But that ship, Captain, either it was many years ahead of us or the most incredible design fluke in history.#
SULU: But a technological rating of only three. They couldn't possibly have put that ship we saw into space.#
SULU: I say planet four, Captain. At least planet four is ahead of three technologically.#
SULU: A hunch, Captain?#
SULU: Warp factor two, sir.#
SULU: I don't believe this myself, Captain, but we're travelling at warp factor eight point five.#
SULU: Warp factor nine and accelerating.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Captain.#
SULU: Aye, sir. Readings now indicate two point seven two one on the Ritter scale. At the present rate of decrease, we'll have to wait at least seventeen hours more before we can even attempt to enter orbit.#
SULU: The storm's already lasted four hours longer than we've anticipated. Do you suppose our landing party could be in any danger?#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor two.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Just within transporter range, sir.#
SULU: I can't get an accurate fix on the Defiant, Mister Scott, but I know it's drifting away from us. Shall I correct for range, sir?#
SULU: Mister Scott, the Defiant. It's starting to disappear.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: I think he had several spasms of pain.#
SULU: Mister Spock. A vessel approaching on an intercept vector.#
SULU: Range two hundred thousand kilometres. Velocity zero point five one C.#
SULU: They've stopped dead, sir. Range ninety thousand kilometres and holding.#
SULU: Sensor readings are not corresponding to those we received the last time we saw the Defiant.#
SULU: Mister Spock, we're being fired upon.#
SULU: But sir, that'll reduce our phaser power by fifty percent.#
SULU: Phasers locked in, sir.#
SULU: Ready, Mister Spock.#
SULU: A hit, Mister Spock.#
SULU: Mister Spock, something has just entered sensor range. It's another Tholian, sir. Loskene must've contacted them when he tried to intercept us.#
SULU: Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir?#
SULU: Just beyond phaser range, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Mister Spock, they're closing the web.#
SULU: It's the Captain. Sir, the tractor field is activating.#
SULU: I can't, sir.#
SULU: Warp factor two, sir.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Phasers one and two locked in and ready.#
SULU: Warp factor three, sir.#
SULU: Trouble aboard the Klingon ship. Evidence of explosions, massive destruction.#
SULU: Forward phasers locked and ready to fire, sir.#
SULU: Warp factor three, sir.#
SULU: Change in course. Accelerating. Helm dead. Auxiliary navigation dead.#
SULU: Nothing responds, Captain.#
SULU: Nine oh two mark five.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: What's Chekov's grudge against the Klingons? Who's Piotre?#
SULU: His brother? He never had a brother. He's an only child.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: All clear, Mister Scott.#
SULU: Aye.#
SULU: Captain.#
SULU: Aye, Captain.#
SULU: Circuits are in, but systems just aren't responding.#
SULU: Aye, Captain. Power and life-support restored. Remotes on standby.#
SULU: Captain, there's some trouble on the hangar deck. The controls are frozen.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Sir, now I have readings that deflectors are inoperative. The controls are frozen.#
SULU: That's just what happened. He was there, then all of a sudden he wasn't there.#
SULU: Yes.#
SULU: Somebody's repairing every console on the ship.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: What kind of earthquakes do they have in this place?#
SULU: It's gone! The Enterprise, it's gone!#
SULU: The Enterprise must have blown up. That would explain the high radiation readings, wouldn't it, Captain? If the matter - antimatter engines#
SULU: Once in Siberia there was a meteor so great that it flattened whole forests and was felt as far away as#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Yes, Captain. All vegetation is inedible. Poison to us.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Sulu to Captain.#
SULU: Captain, I was making a standard magnetic sweep. From zero, I suddenly got a reading that was off the scale. Then, a reverse of polarity and now I get nothing. I've never seen anything like this reading. Like a door opened and then closed again.#
SULU: Poor D'Amato. What a terrible way to die.#
SULU: That's the same red rock.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: It looks so lonely there.#
SULU: Doctor, how can you joke about it?#
SULU: You remember on Janus Six, the silicon creatures#
SULU: Beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the Enterprise?#
SULU: The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of diburnium-osmium. It couldn't have evolved naturally.#
SULU: But Captain, where are the people who made it? Why can't we see them?#
SULU: I'll take the first watch, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir. (Sulu sets up the tricorder on a rock ledge, and leaves it beeping away to itself.)#
SULU: Who are you?#
SULU: How do you know this? Where did you get this information? Are you from this planet?#
SULU: Then the planet is hollow. Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato? All right. The captain will want to talk to you. That way. Move!#
SULU: What do you want?#
SULU: You were on the Enterprise. Keep back! Stop or I'll shoot! I don't want to have to kill a woman.#
SULU: Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk! (As he backs away, Sulu falls over a stone. Losira manages to brush his shoulder before he gets away, screaming in pain, and Kirk steps in front of her.)#
SULU: Don't let her touch you, Captain! That's how D'Amato died. Phasers won't stop her.#
SULU: How can such people be, Captain? Such evil and she's so, so beautiful.#
SULU: She just touched me. How could it happen so fast?#
SULU: Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out.#
SULU: I feel fine, Captain.#
SULU: But Captain, how does she know about us? Does she read our minds? Phaser on overload!#
SULU: Captain, I'm getting that strange magnetic sweep again, from zero to off the scale.#
SULU: She must be somewhere.#
SULU: I'd rather be on the Enterprise, sir.#
SULU: It's a very painful affair. I can tell you.#
SULU: Captain, we can no longer protect each other.#
SULU: Captain, sensors indicate a space vehicle of some sort ahead.#
SULU: Coming into range now, sir. It's following a very erratic course.#
SULU: It looks like the one reported stolen from Starbase Four two weeks ago.#
SULU: Tractor beams activated. We have it, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Automatic, sir.#
SULU: It's out of control or a suicide mission.#
SULU: Brace yourself for collision. Brace yourself.#
SULU: No, sir. The ship is unresponsive. We're moving away from Ariannus.#
SULU: I can't understand it. I simply have no control.#
SULU: No one knows how he'll react under pressure, Lokai.#
SULU: Yes, but it happened way back in the twentieth century. There's no such primitive thinking today.#
SULU: Ready here.#
SULU: Locked in, sir.#
SULU: Ready here. (This time the oceans and land masses are very clearly seen. Not a cloud in the sky.)#
SULU: Controls operating. The Enterprise is responding as always. Captain, it's beautiful.#
SULU: But their planet's dead. Does it matter now which one's right?#
SULU: We can't beam anybody down, sir. The force field on the planet is in full operation, and all forms of transport into the asylum dome are blocked off.#
SULU: The force field is weakest on the far side of the planet. We can send down a shuttlecraft carrying a team in environmental suits.#
SULU: There's been an explosion on Elba Two!#
SULU: Yes, sir. Solidly.#
SULU: On the far side of the planet, Mister Scott.#
SULU: Yes, sir.#
SULU: Orbital co-ordinates released, sir.#
SULU: Course one four mark six eight. Synchronous orbit re-established, sir.#
SULU: Ship's phasers ready, sir.#
SULU: Force field still holding, sir.#
SULU: But, sir, that could take years.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: With the captain lost, sir, that's the best they could come up with?#
SULU: I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain.#
SULU: Captain, I'm picking up a high intensity reading.#
SULU: No, sir. An engineer touches Scott's arm to attract his attention.)#
SULU: Captain, it's approaching at warp factor two point six and accelerating.#
SULU: Shields activated, Captain. (The bright thing 'invades' the ship with sparkles. Only Mira does not shield her eyes from it. Then the sparkles withdraw.)#
SULU: No, it was speech that was affected. I couldn't utter a sound.#
SULU: Captain, I've plotted the storm's path.#
SULU: On its present course, it will hit Memory Alpha planetoid as it did us.#
SULU: It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain! Its speed is incredible. It's hitting the planetoid.#
SULU: It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain.#
SULU: Enterprise to Captain Kirk.#
SULU: Captain, it's changing course.#
SULU: Captain, it's heading straight for us.#
SULU: Shields activated.#
SULU: One four three mark three.#
SULU: Evasive action.#
SULU: Two one seven mark five. Still with us, sir.#
SULU: One one seven mark two. Still with us, sir!#
SULU: Captain, change in velocity recorded. They are passing our starboard side and manoeuvreing in front of us. Switching to forward scanner. Captain, change in velocity recorded. It has accelerated its approach.#
SULU: Locked in, sir.#
SULU: None, sir. They're still approaching us.#
SULU: Locked in, sir.#
SULU: The phasers seem to have stopped their approach. They're holding position.#
SULU: Locked in, sir.#
SULU: Ready for firing, Captain.#
SULU: Bridge to Captain Kirk.#
SULU: Attention. All personnel, attention. Alien force has penetrated the ship.#
SULU: They're veering off, sir.#
SULU: Standing by, sir.#
SULU: Tractor beam engaged.#
SULU: They've not cut power, sir. They're struggling to escape.#
SULU: How do you know what I want?#
SULU: You make it tempting.#
SULU: No explanation, sir.#
SULU: Captain, I get no response from controls. We're going off course.#
SULU: Captain, it seems as though someone else is running the ship.#
SULU: Captain, we're now leaving the Neutral Zone. Bearing into Romulan space!#
SULU: I think so, sir.#
SULU: I'm reading it now, Mister Spock. It seems to indicate artificial power being generated in factor seven quantities.#
SULU: Completing final orbit, sir.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.#
SULU:  All ship's systems going dead. Switch to reserve power. All decks report status.#
SULU: Bridge to Engineering. Come in. What's happening to our power? Bridge to Engineering, report.#
SULU: No answer yet on what caused it. They're standing by.#
SULU: Captain! How can we warn him? (Khan throws a rock at Spock, and a fight starts until the bad guys run off)#
SULU: We should be on warp power within thirty minutes, sir.#
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.#
SULU: Warp factor two, sir.#
SULU: Aye, sir. Three seven three mark eight.#
SULU: Aye, sir.#
SULU: Sulu here, Captain. Starfleet Command is requesting additional details on the delay.#
SULU: The death penalty is forbidden. There's only one exception.#
SULU: The captain really must be going mad if he thinks he can get away with an execution.#
SULU: What difference does it make who he is? Are we going to allow an execution to take place?#
SULU: I'll fight them every way and any way I can.#
