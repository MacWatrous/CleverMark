PARIS: About what?#
PARIS: I'm already doing a job for the Federation.#
PARIS: Well then, I guess I'm yours.#
PARIS: You must be good. My father only accepts the best and the brightest.#
PARIS: I wouldn't if I were you.#
PARIS: I've never seen a Federation starship that could manoeuvre through the plasma storms.#
PARIS: You'd like me to lead you to my former colleagues. I was only with the Maquis a few weeks before I was captured, Captain. I don't know where most of their hiding places are.#
PARIS: What's so important about this particular Maquis ship?#
PARIS: Maybe it's just your Chief of Security who's disappeared.#
PARIS: That's right.#
PARIS: Chakotay will tell you he left Starfleet on principle, to defend his home colony from the Cardassians. I, on the other hand, was forced to resign. He considered me a mercenary, willing to fight for anyone who'd pay my bar bill. Trouble is, he was right. I have no problem helping you track down my friends in the Maquis, Captain. All I need to know from you is what's in it for me.#
PARIS: Ah ha.#
PARIS: Observer? Oh hell, I'm the best pilot you could have.#
PARIS: The story of my life.#
PARIS: Stadi, you're changing my mind about Betazoids.#
PARIS: Oh, that wasn't a compliment. Until today I always considered your people warm and sensual.#
PARIS: Just not to me.#
PARIS: Only when they're in visual range.#
PARIS: Bio-neural?#
PARIS:  Dazzling, aren't they? As bright as a Koladan diamond.#
PARIS: Hard to believe you can find them on any planet in the system.#
PARIS: You know, there's a shop at the Volnar Colony that sells a dozen assorted shapes for one Cardassian lek. How much are you selling these for?#
PARIS: Come on.#
PARIS: Didn't they warn you about Ferengi at the Academy?#
PARIS: Tom Paris, reporting on board.#
PARIS: That's me. As a matter of fact, I seem to be observing some kind of problem right now, Doctor.#
PARIS: It's a long story, Harry, and I'm tired of telling it. I'm sure someone around here will tell you before long. [Ready room] (A split level room with the higher part by the windows, so little Kathryn can stand there and be eye to eye with her crewmen.)#
PARIS: None at all, Captain.#
PARIS: Tomato soup.#
PARIS: Plain.#
PARIS: Hot. Hot, plain, tomato soup. (Paris takes the bowl and goes to sit by Kim. The doctor and Cavit get up and walk away.) PARIS: There, you see? I told you it wouldn't take long.#
PARIS: Was the accident my fault? Yes. Pilot error. But it took me a while to admit it. Oh, fourteen varieties and they can't even get plain tomato soup right.#
PARIS: That's right.#
PARIS: What's the difference? I lied.#
PARIS: I'll tell you the truth, Harry. All I had to do was keep my mouth shut and I was home free. But I couldn't. The ghosts of those three dead officers came to me in the middle of the night and taught me the true meaning of Christmas. So I confessed. Worst mistake I ever made but not my last. After they cashiered me out of Starfleet, I went out looking for a fight and found the Maquis. And on my first assignment, I was caught.#
PARIS: Frankly, I think it was tougher on my father than it was on me. Look, I know those guys told you to stay away from me. And you know what? You ought to listen to them. I'm not exactly a good luck charm.#
PARIS: Go ahead.#
PARIS: I'd guess they were trying to get to one of the M-class planetoids in the Terikof Belt.#
PARIS: A plasma storm might not leave any debris.#
PARIS: She's dead.#
PARIS: Harry, wait for me.#
PARIS: They must have been right next to the console when it exploded. (Kim gets asbestos gauntlets and an extinguisher and puts the fire out.)#
PARIS: We lost our nurse too.#
PARIS: Well, we may be stuck with you for a while, Doc.#
PARIS: Captain?#
PARIS: The crew's scattered around this farm, Captain, but they're all accounted for.#
PARIS: No reason to be rude.#
PARIS: What?#
PARIS: Where?#
PARIS: Paris to Janeway.#
PARIS: Computer, locate Ensign Kim.#
PARIS: Paris to Janeway.#
PARIS: It's good to see you too, Chakotay.#
PARIS: An examination?#
PARIS: Not all of us were.#
PARIS: Captain. I'd like to go with you.#
PARIS: It doesn't. I'd just, I'd hate to see anything happen to Harry.#
PARIS: Why would anyone want to live in a place like this?#
PARIS: They're in this one. Harry! Paris to Janeway.#
PARIS: They're in one of the tunnels, Captain. I can't see them, but they're up there. We're going after them.#
PARIS: Go ahead.#
PARIS: Understood.#
PARIS: I see them. (Torres and Kim are on the next landing, exhausted. The weapons fire makes the staircase rattle.)#
PARIS: How could I let down the only friend I've got?#
PARIS: Paris to Janeway.#
PARIS: We found them, Captain.#
PARIS: Voyager, can you get a lock on us now?#
PARIS: The others are. Get down! (A weapon hit shakes the shaft, throwing Janeway, Chakotay and Tuvok off balance, and a cloud dust comes out of the hole.) PARIS: Paris to Janeway. Chakotay, Tuvok, do you read? Voyager, prepare to transport everyone in this group except me.#
PARIS: Voyager, make that three to beam up. Lock in on the other comm. badge and energise.#
PARIS: I'll get Chakotay. (Neelix, Janeway and Tuvok leave the top of the staircase. Another weapons hit dislodges the metal from the rock wall and breaks the joins. Chakotay is hanging on by his fingertips.)#
PARIS: I intend to, as soon as I get you up.#
PARIS: Yeah? But on the other hand, if I save your butt your life belongs to me. Isn't that some kind of Indian custom?#
PARIS: I don't believe you.#
PARIS: You'd rather die than let me be the one to rescue you?#
PARIS: Isn't there some Indian trick where you can turn yourself into a bird and fly us out of here?#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: I'm getting you out of there, Chakotay.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: We're in position.#
PARIS: You asked to see me, Captain.#
PARIS: Will you provide a bodyguard for me, Captain?#
PARIS: I do?#
PARIS: I think I'm going to enjoy this.#
PARIS: Me?#
PARIS: Er, for the first time in my life I don't know what to say.#
PARIS: Oh, he'll know. When we get back.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Here you are.#
PARIS: Not to mention its lousy bedside manner.#
PARIS: Er, only two semesters.#
PARIS: But Captain#
PARIS: We're being pulled toward the singularity.#
PARIS: We're moving forward again.#
PARIS: Captain, according to these readings, we've returned to our previous co-ordinates. This isn't another singularity. It's the same one.#
PARIS: They can't both be right. We're either still at the singularity or we're not.#
PARIS: Warp engines holding steady. All systems report normal.#
PARIS: No. We're still steady on three one zero mark two one five.#
PARIS: It's the Voyager. It's us.#
PARIS: Sensors confirm it's definitely USS Voyager.#
PARIS: Wait a minute. Wait. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. We were cruising along at warp seven, then we pick up a distress call and moved in to investigate. But now you're saying that the other ship is actually just a reflection of us and that the distress call is actually just the Captain's opening hail. But we picked up the distress call before she sent the hail. How could we have been seeing a reflection of something we hadn't even done yet? Am I making any sense here?#
PARIS: Scanning the singularity.#
PARIS: I'm picking up something. A slight irregularity. It could be a rupture in the event horizon.#
PARIS: It is a rupture, Captain. It's fifteen metres by ten metres.#
PARIS: Captain, if we get too close to the rupture our warp engines might make it collapse even further.#
PARIS: You'll need the best pilot you've got in that shuttle, Captain. That'll be me.#
PARIS: They'll have to widen it twice that much before Voyager can make it through.#
PARIS: Aye, sir.#
PARIS: I'm losing power to the port impulse engine.#
PARIS: Sometimes you just have to punch your way through. I'll have to remember that one.#
PARIS: Oh, it's all right. It's just a scratch, really. You know, I like you better this way.#
PARIS: Holding course three five one mark one zero, warp seven. We'll be passing a red dwarf system in forty minutes. I can't tell you if there are any M-class planets.#
PARIS: You ready?#
PARIS: Harry, I can't do this alone.#
PARIS: You're making a big mistake. Can't you see what's going to happen? We're the only humans out here, Harry. People are going to start pairing off, and if we don't get to the Delany sisters in Stellar Cartography soon, somebody else will.#
PARIS: So what? I've got five.#
PARIS: Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. You really think she's going to wait for you?#
PARIS: Let her go. Let her have a husband and kids and a good life, while you and I have the Delany sisters.#
PARIS: You need to run a self-diagnostic. Look, they come as a pair. It's a double date or no date. Come on. I told them all about you.#
PARIS: Well, for one thing, how you broke the single pilot speed record at the Academy.#
PARIS: And who are they going to check it with? (Something hits Voyager, starting it shaking. Janeway and Neelix stagger in from the Briefing room.)#
PARIS: I'm not sure. Scanners are picking up a debris cloud in the red dwarf system we're approaching.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Entering the system Captain. Heading zero one zero mark four. Deflectors at maximum.#
PARIS: The origin of the shockwave is an M-class planet, Captain. We're within visual range.#
PARIS: None. But the polaric radiation may be interfering with the scanners.#
PARIS: If that's what happened, the people here never had a chance.#
PARIS: I wonder who won?#
PARIS: Look. This may be some kind of time piece, stopped at the moment of the explosion.#
PARIS: What was that?#
PARIS: Didn't you hear that?#
PARIS: Kids playing. They were as close to me as (Paris is in the sunshine again. Children are playing ball as men and women go about their business. He is in front of a clock shop. A hand touches his shoulder and he is back in the gloom again. It was Janeway.) PARIS: I don't understand. I was here in this square, but there were people.#
PARIS: But I saw them! Lots of people, children playing, and the sun was shining. There was no evidence of an explosion. Everyone was alive and happy.#
PARIS: No problem.#
PARIS: Er, this is a little more formal than most. You know how it is when you travel.#
PARIS: I wish I could say it will be. (He goes to the shop display where the timepiece is counting. 371-20-01 The owner comes out.)#
PARIS: Maybe you could help me. I'm from Kalto Province. I'm not used to your timepieces.#
PARIS: Are you sure? What do these numbers stand for?#
PARIS: A fair price. I might stop back later, if there's time.#
PARIS: If I understood correctly, this world is going to be destroyed sometime tomorrow. First officers log, supplemental. There's been no sign of Captain Janeway or Lieutenant Paris since they were lost in a subspace fracture.#
PARIS: Maybe there's some way that#
PARIS: Even if the natural course of events is annihilation?#
PARIS: My father used to talk at length to us about the Prime Directive, once a year, like a holiday sermon.#
PARIS: To be honest, I tuned out most of his sermons years ago.#
PARIS: The consequences would have to be better than mass destruction.#
PARIS: We ate him, because we are demons and we eat children and I haven't had my supper yet.#
PARIS: Sorry. I just figured it was the quickest way.#
PARIS: The same subspace fractures that brought us here might still be around. If they were caused by a polaric explosion? Is there any way we could use polaric energy to get us back?#
PARIS: I wonder where these conduits get their power? [Outside the Power Plant] (Guards are holding back angry demonstrators with physical violence.)#
PARIS: Under normal circumstances I'd say we should come back tomorrow. (The young boy has followed them and is watching from the bushes. The guards fire rounds into the air to disperse the crowd. Friends help the injured limp away. One over-enthusiastic guard hits Janeway in the face, knocking her down, so Paris hits him. A demonstrator helps Janeway up, and he leaves with her and Paris.)#
PARIS: I was just thinking the very same thing.#
PARIS: Infiltrate? You were there when she got this.#
PARIS: We don't even know why someone would want to infiltrate you.#
PARIS: We were just getting there when we stumbled into you.#
PARIS: Thanks, kid.#
PARIS: Hey, kid, you were right about one thing. I was lying. I don't eat children#
PARIS: What is he, some kind of journalist?#
PARIS: Is that right?#
PARIS: What's your name?#
PARIS: Latika. I'm sorry.#
PARIS: I just am.#
PARIS: We weren't allowed to tell. At least, I thought we weren't.#
PARIS: How did we do that?#
PARIS: What?#
PARIS: Four oh one twenty two eighty four. Wait a minute. You're saying we're responsible for an explosion even though it occurred before our ship arrived here.#
PARIS: Let's say we never came, and their plans didn't change. Wouldn't the accident simply have occurred next week instead of today?#
PARIS: Don't waste time with me, Captain. Got to stop them.#
PARIS: Sure he will, the kid and I, we're old friends now, aren't we?#
PARIS: We'll be here. (Janeway follows Makull, Terla and their helper down the circular corridors to where they are working on a control panel.) [Ruined corridor] (The away team beam into the same corridor after the explosion.)#
PARIS: Let her go. Let her have a husband and kids and a good life, while you and I have the Delany sisters.#
PARIS: You need to run a self-diagnostic. Look, they come as a pair. It's a double date or no date. Come on. I told them all about you.#
PARIS: Well, for one thing, how you broke the single pilot speed record at the Academy.#
PARIS: And who are they going to check it with?#
PARIS: Come on. Come on. Just go.#
PARIS: No, I'm afraid they didn't.#
PARIS: We don't have one.#
PARIS: Right.#
PARIS: What are you doing?#
PARIS: I thought you just said we can't replicate his lungs.#
PARIS: Holographic lungs?#
PARIS: But a hologram is just a projection of light held in a magnetic containment field. There's no real matter involved.#
PARIS: Kes, I know it sounds pretty grim, but it's better than losing him completely. This way, he'll still be alive, and maybe we can find a better solution somewhere down the road. What do you think Neelix would want?#
PARIS: Okay. The isotropic restraint is activated. He won't be able to move more than two microns in any direction.#
PARIS: His cellular toxicity is rising. Eight two percent. Eighty six percent.#
PARIS: It's offline.#
PARIS: Ninety percent. Ninety five percent.#
PARIS: Toxicity returning to normal. Captain's log, supplemental. We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon. They are not responding to hails and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed.#
PARIS: I'm on my way, Captain. You know where I am if you need me.#
PARIS: It's entered the asteroid, Captain.#
PARIS: I think I've located where the alien ship entered. There's an open crater on the limb of the asteroid.#
PARIS: The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside.#
PARIS: Two hundred metres in diameter.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Captain, I'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only. This passageway is getting a little too narrow for my taste.#
PARIS: Thanks, Captain.#
PARIS: I'm still picking up the alien's ion trail. Maybe we should follow that.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: And I'm sure the gastrointestinal problems will go away as soon as our systems get used to his, er, gourmet touch.#
PARIS: Ensigns don't invite captains to sit down.#
PARIS: Because they don't.#
PARIS: Captains don't want courtesy, they want respect. That's why they don't get chummy with the lower ranks.#
PARIS: If she wants to sit with us, she'll ask us to join her. That's the way it's done.#
PARIS: Captain. We're approaching the perimeter of the nebula.#
PARIS: I'm showing mostly hydrogen, helium and hydroxyl radicals. Some local dust nodules. I don't see them giving us any trouble.#
PARIS: Density has increased to forty two percent.#
PARIS: Not sure. We seem to be drawing some interstellar dust toward us.#
PARIS: Density still increasing. Up by seventy percent now.#
PARIS: We're at a dead stop now.#
PARIS: Acknowledged. Engaging thrusters.#
PARIS: Captain, the breach we just make when we penetrated the field? It just closed behind us. [Mess Hall]#
PARIS: Reversing course.#
PARIS: We're not penetrating the energy barrier this time.#
PARIS: I'll be riding the tail of our torpedo, Captain.#
PARIS: I'm having trouble navigating through the energy currents. It's as thick as a Toarian ice storm out there.#
PARIS: Dark enough for you?#
PARIS: Get up, Harry. Something you've got to see.#
PARIS: You'd be surprised the things you learn in prison.#
PARIS: You could've changed roommates.#
PARIS: Ah.#
PARIS: Harry, in order to be reminded of something, you have to first#
PARIS: Right.#
PARIS: Nothing that's going to compare to that memory of your mother's womb. Computer, activate holodeck programme Paris three.#
PARIS: What do you think, Harry?#
PARIS: This is where I spent most of my second semester at the Academy. I chose the Starfleet base outside of Marseilles for my physical training. I always had a thing about the French.#
PARIS: Sandrine, this is my friend Harry Kim.#
PARIS: Sandrine owns the place. It's been in her family over six hundred years.#
PARIS: This is Ricky. I include her in all my holoprograms.#
PARIS: French father, Daliwakan mother.#
PARIS: I wouldn't have it any other way.#
PARIS: Harry, this is France. Er, break open a bottle of that '46 Saint Emilion you save behind the bar for me.#
PARIS: Harry, it's holographic wine. It doesn't give you acid. Try to get in the mood, huh?#
PARIS: I learned a great deal that semester at the Academy, most of it right here.#
PARIS: I found this place just after my pocket was picked walking by the harbour.#
PARIS: Oh, they just do it for tourists. They give it back. Most of the time.#
PARIS: You see that pool table, Harry? The table at Sandrine's at Marseilles has attracted the world's greatest hustlers throughout the centuries. I thought it might be fun to programme in some of the great players to shoot with.#
PARIS: Gaunt Gary, Ames Pool Hall, New York City, 1953. They say that he hustled the great Willie Mosconi himself.#
PARIS: Oh, he's not ready for you yet, Gary. Let me teach him a few tricks first.#
PARIS: I'm not sure. Some old kind of Scandinavian currency. Come on. I'll rack them up, you pick out a cue. Harry, this is my idea of home. My little piece of Earth out here in the Delta Quadrant.#
PARIS: What?#
PARIS: Your shot, Harry. [Doctor's office] (Torres has put a sample into a centrifuge in Engineering and found the results interesting.)#
PARIS: Er, Captain?#
PARIS: Approaching the perimeter.#
PARIS: Impulse engines offline.#
PARIS: Thrusters engaged.#
PARIS: Density is already more than double what we encountered last time.#
PARIS: Ambient density is dropping.#
PARIS: I can see it.#
PARIS: Coming about forty degrees.#
PARIS: Field processors coming back on-line. Inertial damping restored.#
PARIS: Approximately seventy thousand kilometres from our former position. Deeper inside the creature than before.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: No engines?#
PARIS: We could get in one of those currents and surf back.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. We're on our way. Speed, all of two hundred KPH.#
PARIS: No.#
PARIS: Captain?#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: And how are we supposed to get the ship into the wound without getting the hell beat out of us again?#
PARIS: That's sort of like asking a hurt dog not to bite you while you tend to its wounds.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. I always had a dog.#
PARIS: I'd feel better if I had twenty.#
PARIS: Ten sounds good.#
PARIS: Just tell me when.#
PARIS: Forty thousand kilometres to the perimeter. Thirty thousand.#
PARIS: We've cleared the central mass. Captain's Log, supplemental. We set out to augment our energy reserves and wound up depleting them by over twenty percent. As a result, we've set a new course for a planet fourteen light years away that Neelix says might have compatible energy sources to offer us. It is out of our way, but circumstances offer few alternatives. So much for raising spirits.#
PARIS: Easy, honey. I'm setting the Indian up for the big hustle.#
PARIS: Yeah, that's exactly what he's supposed to think, too.#
PARIS: Er, yeah. It's just a little diversion, Captain.#
PARIS: I'm sorry. If I had some kind of warning that you were coming#
PARIS: Yeah. Why?#
PARIS: Er, pool.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. And may I suggest, if this works, we petition the Federation Astronomical Committee to officially designate this the Harry Kim Wormhole.#
PARIS: Captain, we're approaching the coordinates of the wormhole.#
PARIS: Sensors also indicate it's there.#
PARIS: I guess it's a little too small for us to fly through.#
PARIS: It doesn't look like any wormhole I've ever studied.#
PARIS: Does that mean we can't send a message through it?#
PARIS: Captain, I'm getting a distorted energy reading.#
PARIS: How will we know if the signal reaches somebody?#
PARIS: I'm getting it too. A subspace signal relayed through the probe.#
PARIS: Why would he pretend to be a cargo captain.#
PARIS: Okay, we've got the communications frequency locked in.#
PARIS: How can we do that? We'd be going back to a time when you were only two years old.#
PARIS: No, I#
PARIS: I'd better be on my way.#
PARIS: That's not the way it happened.#
PARIS: That has nothing to do with#
PARIS: I can't let you do that.#
PARIS: Nice to meet you.#
PARIS: What are you looking at?#
PARIS: What are you looking at? (Lidell enters and throws a piece of food onto the floor. The dog pounces on it immediately.)#
PARIS: And here we are bringing more of it home to take your husband's attention away for the evening.#
PARIS: Captain Janeway decided not to take our ship into orbit. She wanted to avoid getting involved in your conflict. So, we came in on a shuttlecraft that would avoid immediate detection by the Numiri. I hid behind the limb of the moon before I made a break for your defence perimeter. By the time their sensors picked us up, they didn't have a chance to catch us.#
PARIS: Captain.#
PARIS: I've been better.#
PARIS: The rehab colony back in New Zealand doesn't seem so bad right now.#
PARIS: No!#
PARIS: You don't have to tell me what the victim's own eyes saw, Captain. I don't understand it either, but I did not kill him.#
PARIS: Their marriage was over. She told Ren they were finished the same day he was killed.#
PARIS: Nothing happened between us. Almost nothing.#
PARIS: I was bored. You know how it is when two science guys get together. [The Ren's home] PARIS#
PARIS: Smoking is a bad habit. My species gave it up centuries ago when we finally got it into our heads it was killing us.#
PARIS: That's not what I meant.#
PARIS: Now why would you go and say a thing like that?#
PARIS: What?#
PARIS: I was just trying to#
PARIS: Look, I was just bored to tears in the other room and I thought you might like to talk.#
PARIS: Ask you what?#
PARIS: I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been wondering.#
PARIS: That sounds like a good enough reason to me.#
PARIS: I guess that makes you a good woman.#
PARIS: No! No!#
PARIS: There must be a centimetre of water in my boots.#
PARIS: We shouldn't.#
PARIS: But you're still a married woman.#
PARIS: Eclipse?#
PARIS: Our timing's just a little off.#
PARIS: Sitting with her, drinking tea, talking about the sensual effects of eclipses. After that, I must've fallen asleep. When I woke up, I was in a cell.#
PARIS: I'd better be on my way.#
PARIS: That's not the way it happened.#
PARIS: I can't let you do that.#
PARIS: Yeah. I consider you the conscience I never had. You're supposed to keep me on the straight and narrow.#
PARIS: Funny, so did she.#
PARIS: Someday it will be you, Harry. You'll meet her, and you'll know it's wrong from the first moment you see her, and you'll know there's nothing you can do about it.#
PARIS: Seven hours.#
PARIS: Just what was in that tea you gave me, Lidell?#
PARIS: Symbols? Well, yeah, I guess I did. I didn't know what they meant. I thought they were part of the procedure.#
PARIS: Yeah, you could.#
PARIS: Tuvok.#
PARIS: There are some who'd say you risked my future on the eyewitness identification of a dog.#
PARIS: Well, I appreciate you sticking up for me. I owe you one.#
PARIS: How come I always see you down here eating alone, Lieutenant?#
PARIS: Close enough. You don't make many friends that way.#
PARIS: Well, like it or not, you've made one today, Mister Tuvok.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.  Paris to Janeway. I've brought us out of warp. We're point six light years from the ring system.#
PARIS: Well, we did take that trip to Venice with them.#
PARIS: Yeah, you know, I've been meaning to ask you. What happened when you and Jenny Delaney disappeared in that gondola?#
PARIS: I think maybe Harry wasn't quite prepared for how voracious Jenny Delaney can be.#
PARIS: What fence?#
PARIS: Even we think so sometimes.#
PARIS: But what do we have to offer? They seem to have everything they need.#
PARIS: But it's not above board. The Captain is only going to deal with an official representative.#
PARIS: Just tell her everything you know. Let her take it from there.#
PARIS: I'll walk you part way. I'm headed for bed.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. There's no response. Thrusters are offline.#
PARIS: It's like a reflection, something in low orbit when it moves into a certain angle from the sun.#
PARIS: Nothing showing up, Captain.#
PARIS: New heading entered.#
PARIS: At their current speed, four hours twenty minutes. Should I tell them we're here?#
PARIS: Friendly sort.#
PARIS: The Kazon ship#
PARIS:: I'm not willing to accept the fact that Harry and the others are gone for good. Their molecular patterns might still be there. And if they are, we might be able to rematerialise them. The only thing we can do is go back into the holodeck, study this energy surge, find out what exactly happened.#
PARIS: Maybe not anyone.#
PARIS: A hologram can't be converted into energy. It already is energy. You're the perfect choice.#
PARIS:: Paris to Janeway. We're ready for the transfer, Captain.#
PARIS: How about you, Doctor? Are you ready?#
PARIS: I've already transported a tricorder onto the holodeck. Engaging transfer circuits now. [Holodeck - Forest] (Night time. The EMH picks up the tricorder then gets his first feel of tree bark.)#
PARIS: Er, I have him, Captain, more or less. I think you'd better come take a look at this.#
PARIS: How does it feel?#
PARIS: I'll give you a hand.#
PARIS:: It's producing a synaptic pattern, all right. Highly complex. (The orange energy leaves the container and flies off through Engineering.)#
PARIS:: Whatever it is, it's cutting through the bulkheads.#
PARIS:: It's heading for deck fourteen, section C five.#
PARIS:: Oh. It's changing direction. It's like it's avoiding the containment field.#
PARIS:: It's changing course, heading for the open side.#
PARIS:: Those synaptic patterns could be some sort of neural net.#
PARIS:: It's cutting its way through the ship, heading for the outer hull. It'll breach in about fifteen seconds.#
PARIS: Negative.#
PARIS: I'm showing the energy form one hundred metres off our port side.#
PARIS: The lattice is gone again.#
PARIS: Our new heading is one twenty one mark six. We've completely come about, Captain, but it wasn't me.#
PARIS: I'm telling you, it wasn't me, and the helm controls are working perfectly. No sign of a malfunction.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: I've checked every ODN junction in the helm control network, and I still can't find the problem.#
PARIS: That's not true.#
PARIS: I passed by the navigational control on my way back from the Jefferies tube, but that's all. Am I being accused of something here?#
PARIS: I'm telling you, I didn't do it.#
PARIS: All right.#
PARIS: What I wouldn't give to see good old Doc Brown right now.#
PARIS: Doc Brown. Lollipops in the waiting room, no holocomic books more than six months old, house calls. I caught a bad cold one time when I was nine years old. The doctor whipped up a pot of garlic soup and brought it over himself.#
PARIS: I guess you're going to have to round up another suspect, Tuvok.#
PARIS: That's impossible.#
PARIS: To be honest, I don't know what to think.#
PARIS: Another brain wave? Whose?#
PARIS: That's true. So far it's only affected organic beings. If it could control the computer and navigational systems directly, it probably would've done it already.#
PARIS: I feel better already.#
PARIS: The most thorough scanning device we have on board is a magneton scanner. We could search the ship centimetre by centimetre, but that wouldn't do much good. This alien could be anywhere at any time.#
PARIS: That should do it, Captain.#
PARIS: Right.#
PARIS: Captain, I've finished the bioanalysis the doctor was running on Kes before he was deactivated. I think he was on to something. If I'm interpreting his data correctly, the bruises on Kes's neck and shoulders were the result of a Vulcan neck pinch.#
PARIS: I don't get it. If the alien's in Tuvok, how could it be down in Engineering at the same time?#
PARIS: Two?#
PARIS: Shields are holding, but they won't last long at this rate, and the electromagnetic radiation is blinding our sensors. I can't find a way out.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: Or a map.#
PARIS: The stones are in the same position as those three planetoids. Chakotay must be using them to point a way out.#
PARIS: They're the ones with the guns, remember?#
PARIS: Agreed. But I don't want to do anything until we find out what they've done with B'Elanna. In the meantime, we have to keep track of the guards movements. How long are their shifts, when do they eat, when do they sleep?#
PARIS: We'll find an opening, Pete, and when the time is right we'll make our move.#
PARIS: Something funny, friend?#
PARIS: Really. How's that?#
PARIS: Seems like you know this place pretty well.#
PARIS: Then tell me something. I thought those Vidiians were in the business of harvesting organs. How come we're all still in one piece?#
PARIS: Thanks for the advice.#
PARIS: Listen. When they grabbed us there was a woman with us. B'Elanna Torres. Any idea what might have happened to her?#
PARIS: B'Elanna?#
PARIS: B'Elanna, what have they done to you?#
PARIS: Yes, they stunned all of us.#
PARIS: It doesn't seem possible, but you look human.#
PARIS: Considering what they've done to you, I'm not surprised.#
PARIS: What?#
PARIS: When I was a kid, I wore a cap to cover the haircuts my father used to make me get first day of every summer.#
PARIS: Looks like you finally got what you wanted.#
PARIS: They're coming to take us to the work detail. You can't let them see how sick you are.#
PARIS: Or maybe they'll skip the preliminaries and take you straight to organ processing.#
PARIS: I'm the senior officer here. If your superiors want to talk with one of us, it should be me. He's not going anywhere without me.#
PARIS: What is it?#
PARIS: Here, B'Elanna. Sit down.#
PARIS: Thanks.#
PARIS: What do you mean?#
PARIS: No one could blame you for that.#
PARIS: B'Elanna, I'm no doctor, but I have to believe that what ever they did to you has seriously depleted your strength. There's nothing you could have done.#
PARIS: Sometimes fear can be a good thing. Keeps you from taking unnecessary chances. Courage doesn't mean that you don't have fear. It means that you've learnt to overcome it. And I know that you can find the courage to hold on until we can find a way out of this place.#
PARIS: She's ill. She needed a rest.#
PARIS: Tell me how to get there.#
PARIS: Keep your hands off me!#
PARIS: Chakotay?#
PARIS: I think they've been taken to what the Vidiians call organ processing.#
PARIS: it's a defensive strategy. Since you can't make a shot, the idea is to leave the cue ball somewhere on the table where Tuvok can't make a shot either.#
PARIS: This I have to see.#
PARIS: You were afraid.#
PARIS: Propulsion is down.#
PARIS: Nacelle controls deactivated. Ready to go.#
PARIS: I don't know about the bacteria, but I'm about ready to pass out.#
PARIS: I'll try.#
PARIS: What? What are you talking about? Help this man.#
PARIS: Look, are you going to help this man or not?#
PARIS: Who the hell are you?#
PARIS: What are you#
PARIS: Doctor, are you listening to me? That man needs help!#
PARIS: What was that all about?#
PARIS: Really? Sorry I missed it.#
PARIS: Yeah. See you later.#
PARIS: Take care.#
PARIS: Any idea what it is?#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. (Kes returns the stray spawn beetle to the Airponics bay and starts tending some small tomato plants. She absent mindedly reaches into a box of the beetles, scoops up a handfull and eats them. She picks up a second, then realises what she is doing.)#
PARIS: They're really moving.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: I'm trying to slow down, Captain.#
PARIS: They seem to be pulling us toward them.#
PARIS: We're getting closer.#
PARIS: Helm controls aren't responding, Captain.#
PARIS: They're pulling us in.#
PARIS: Warp drive's still online. One burst and we'd be out of here.#
PARIS: Heading one twenty one mark seven. Speed now six thousand kilometres per second.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Impulse engines are losing power.#
PARIS: In a few seconds. We're almost out.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. Two hundred kph.#
PARIS: Now what?#
PARIS: Then these guys think we're one of them?#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. Initiating impulse burst, now.#
PARIS: I'm losing power. Can't shake him.#
PARIS: The feeling definitely isn't mutual.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. Engaging thrusters.#
PARIS: He's just hitting us back harder!#
PARIS: I think so.#
PARIS: Full power to inertial dampers.#
PARIS: Acknowledged.#
PARIS: Oh, it's an old Earth custom called a surprise party.#
PARIS: In a minute. Birthday gifts are also an Earth tradition.#
PARIS: Hey, who am I to fly in the face of tradition?#
PARIS: Two weeks actually, but who's counting? I'm just glad you like it.#
PARIS: Deck four.#
PARIS: That might explain why it took us here instead of the Bridge.#
PARIS: I don't suppose anyone here knows the way to the Bridge? [Holodeck - Sandrine's] (The bar is an impromptu briefing room, with Gaunt Gary playing pool and an accordion player making music in the background.)#
PARIS: When we tried to go to the Bridge, one of the places the turbolift took us was Engineering. Maybe if we repeated our steps, it'll take us back there.#
PARIS: What's going to keep you from getting lost?#
PARIS: Relax, will you? So far, we're right on schedule. The next stop should be#
PARIS: I think you handled that very well, Lieutenant.#
PARIS: Pattern buffers activated.#
PARIS: Lost him?#
PARIS: So what do we do now?#
PARIS: It's as if the entire ship is being compressed and twisted.#
PARIS: Besides, this ship is so contorted, there's no reason to expect we'd have any navigational control.#
PARIS: You're saying it made things worse?#
PARIS: We're not going anywhere. (Tuvok scans the encroaching distortion while Torres and Kim work at the holodeck controls.) PARIS: Do you really think it's possible to project a stable holographic force field?#
PARIS: Fire away, Harry.#
PARIS: I chose this life. And I guess I always knew it could come to this. But yeah, I'm afraid.#
PARIS: The distortion ring's directly ahead, Captain. It's moving away from us at two thousand kph.#
PARIS: Hey. Watch it, will you? I'm trying to set up a shot here.#
PARIS: Who the hell are you?#
PARIS: Sure. We were at the Academy together, right?#
PARIS: Oh. Well, it must have been the Exeter. We served on the Exeter together?#
PARIS: Ah, Voyager. Well, sorry to disappoint you, but I never set foot on that ship. And I can't say that I'm sorry, considering what happened to it.#
PARIS: Oh, yeah. Captain Janeway asked if I'd help her track down that Maquis ship in exchange for an early release from the penal colony.#
PARIS: What? Are you kidding? I said yes! It sounded better than Starfleet Rehab. Anyway, I got as far as Deep Space Nine, where I got into a bar fight with a Ferengi, and I was thrown into the brig by a very unpleasant shapeshifter. Janeway tried to get me released but my parole was revoked by Starfleet Command. Voyager left without me.#
PARIS: Yeah. How do you know about that?#
PARIS: You're right. That does sound crazy.#
PARIS: What is it you want?#
PARIS:  You had me there for a minute. You really did. But then you blew it.#
PARIS: You're not getting me to set foot inside Starfleet Headquarters. So you tell whatever admiral or captain who sent you that I'm not interested in being another pawn in one of their games.#
PARIS: Oh, it isn't? Oh, that's a shame. I like games.#
PARIS: You know, you're starting to annoy me.#
PARIS: What do you see, Ensign?#
PARIS: Excuse me.#
PARIS: Ow! There goes my bank shot.#
PARIS: Helping out a friend. Let's go.#
PARIS: I still have a few friends at Starfleet. They told me you were in some serious trouble.#
PARIS: I know the feeling. Those security anklets really chafe, don't they?#
PARIS: Let's just say it's been a long time since anybody gave a damn about my future, including me. I don't know if I'm supposed to be on Voyager like you've told me, but it sounds a whole lot better than the life I have here. I'm willing to take my chances, Ensign.#
PARIS: Won't be long before they find us. We better keep moving.#
PARIS: Sounds to me like you need a pilot.#
PARIS: I know someone who used to be pretty good. And if I'm not mistaken, he still knows a few tricks.#
PARIS: Site-to-site transporter. With friends like mine, you never know when it'll come in handy. Where's your office?#
PARIS: I can beam us in. But we'll only have a few minutes before Security starts kicking down the door.#
PARIS: Might?#
PARIS: Security's just been alerted to an unauthorised transport in the building. It'll take them another twenty seconds to track it to this office. How are you coming?#
PARIS: They're onto us. We've got to go.#
PARIS: Now! (One of the security officers fires his phaser. They duck behind the drafting board and there is a transporter sound.)#
PARIS: Let's get those engines going.#
PARIS: Space doors closing.#
PARIS: Releasing docking clamps. Moorings clear. Here we go. (Paris does the traditional ninety degree roll to get through the gap in the space doors.) PARIS: We're clear.#
PARIS: Adjusting course to match. Going to full impulse.#
PARIS: I'll try to lose them, Harry, but they're a lot faster than we are.#
PARIS: They're closing to five thousand kilometres.#
PARIS: I thought you said this ship was new and improved.#
PARIS: We're approaching the coordinates of the time stream.#
PARIS: The ship's closing to three thousand kilometres.#
PARIS: So?#
PARIS: We could vent the warp plasma. The second they hit the plasma cloud, their engines would stall. Give us a few seconds of breathing room.#
PARIS: Unlocking the warp drive manifold.#
PARIS: Any second. They've dropped to one tenth impulse. Our containment field's at critical. We'd better hurry.#
PARIS: You think?#
PARIS: Increasing speed to one hundred and forty thousand kph.#
PARIS: Approaching coordinates. Impact in four, three, two.#
PARIS: We passed through the coordinates, but the runabout was unaffected. The starship has repowered its engines. They'll be here in under a minute.#
PARIS: Are you crazy?#
PARIS: I've locked onto the time stream. Get on the transporter pad.#
PARIS: There's no time. That ship'll be here in another thirty seconds.#
PARIS: Look. If you're right, then things will be changed back to the way they're supposed to be, and you'll find me back on Voyager.#
PARIS: Go! (Paris pushes Kim onto the transporter pad and activates it. Yellowstone goes KaBOOM!) [Shuttlecraft Drake] JANEWAY#
PARIS: The hull is starting to buckle under the stress. He won't survive much longer.#
PARIS: Ten seconds to hull breach.#
PARIS: Hull breach in progress.#
PARIS: Welcome back. Kind of a rough ride, huh? What is it, Harry?#
PARIS: Inertial dampers have failed.#
PARIS: Did you verify the control inputs?#
PARIS: Plasma injectors.#
PARIS: Field coils responding. Inertial dampers back online.#
PARIS: As your flight instructor, it's my duty to prepare you for anything, fair or not.#
PARIS: Yes, well, I'm famous for my dirty tricks, you know?#
PARIS: I never said the simulation was finished.#
PARIS: Oh, ho! Sounds like a challenge to me.#
PARIS: That was you?#
PARIS: I'm impressed.#
PARIS: Play something for me.#
PARIS: Oh, come on. Play something. Just pretend I'm not here.#
PARIS: Play something different.#
PARIS: Something not so cheerful.#
PARIS: What, you don't take requests?#
PARIS: Oh, Harry. I'm in trouble.#
PARIS: I think I'm in love.#
PARIS: With Kes.#
PARIS: I know. I know. I never even saw it coming. I thought we were just good buddies. But there she was in my arms.#
PARIS: What? Oh, no. I didn't. I wouldn't. She stumbled during a flight simulation. I caught her. I held her for an instant. Are you going to play or not?#
PARIS: A whole crew full of women and I have to fall for the one I can't have. Why do I do this to my self?#
PARIS: Enjoy it?#
PARIS: Hey, don't knock it if you haven't tried it. I just have to be more careful. I can't let myself be alone with her.#
PARIS: That's not a Chinese expression.#
PARIS: Of course, it would help a little if Kes and I weren't going to be stuck on the same ship for the rest of our lives.#
PARIS: I'm in a pessimistic mood. Play something pessimistic. Practice, Harry, practice.#
PARIS: I think I'll just eat later.#
PARIS: Damn.#
PARIS: Very simple. We just won't sit with her.#
PARIS: No, that's smart. We'll make it look like we have bridge operations to discuss.#
PARIS: Whatever. We just have a lot of bridge operations business to discuss. Yeah.#
PARIS: I beg your pardon?#
PARIS: Oh, a guy just can't win. Look, there is nothing to fool you about. Really. I swear.#
PARIS: What the hell are you doing?#
PARIS: It's too late. I'm betting your hair pasta already did the trick.#
PARIS: Go ahead.#
PARIS: Er, Captain, did you say right away? If we could have#
PARIS: It might be too long to go into right now, Captain.#
PARIS: Captain, I'm not one to pass up a mission, but in this circumstance, maybe Ensign Baytart who is a fine pilot#
PARIS: I'm not trying to impress anyone, I'm entering it into the flight record. Look, can I make a suggestion?#
PARIS: My suggestion is that we put our personal problems aside until this mission is over. Okay?#
PARIS: Fine. Let's get the job done.#
PARIS: Entry sequence at three minutes, mark. All systems, stand by. Have you been briefed on shuttle operations?#
PARIS: Check your console. I'm reading a power output decline of fifteen percent.#
PARIS: We're getting some kind of reaction in our driver coil assembly from the EM anomalies in the atmosphere. I'm going to abort the mission. Hold on. We've lost our impulse drive. Shut off the deuterium flow! I'm dumping excess fuel.#
PARIS: Setting DCA pulse over to neutral. Engaging thrusters.#
PARIS: I'm trying, Neelix. Prepare for an emergency landing. Send out an EMS pulse. There's still a chance Voyager will pick it up.#
PARIS: Sorry. I did the best I could. Any broken bones?#
PARIS: I feel it too. We've got atmospheric leakage in the hull. The trigemic vapours really sting. Here. Doc said this would help a little.#
PARIS: We can't. We'll have to wait for Voyager to find us.#
PARIS: B'Elanna's working on the transporter, and one of those atmospheric windows might open up. In the meantime, we're going to have to look for some kind of cover.#
PARIS: The trigemic vapours are going to#
PARIS: And we may be waiting here for days. Exposure to these vapours is too dangerous. We're leaving. Grab your gear.#
PARIS: An order!#
PARIS: You know, it might be more constructive if you could find us something safe to eat.#
PARIS: Our emergency rations won't last forever.#
PARIS: Oh, don't worry. I've learned to lower my standards since you became cook. I'm picking up some caves about a kilometre west of here.#
PARIS: That should do it.#
PARIS: We'd better conserve our beacon cells.#
PARIS: Oh, there's a whole course at the Academy full of all sorts of survival strategies.#
PARIS: B minus.#
PARIS: My father was teaching the class that year.#
PARIS: What about Talaxian protocols?#
PARIS: No, more like a bed of#
PARIS: Nothing.#
PARIS: Neelix, I didn't say that. I never even#
PARIS: I checked for life signs. There weren't any.#
PARIS: Whatever this life form is, its vital signs are awfully faint.#
PARIS: No, I don't think so. They're faint, but steady.#
PARIS: This is where the life signs are coming from. They're embryonic life forms. These two are half formed. This one almost seems to be#
PARIS: It's hard to say. Most common reptiles lay their eggs and never return to protect them.#
PARIS: True. And if this thing does have a mother, I'd say we don't want to be around when she gets back. Come on.#
PARIS: We're not leaving it here, its mother left it here. We just happened to wander in.#
PARIS: We'll leave the door open for her when we go, okay?#
PARIS: There's not much we can do about that now, is there? We should just leave all this the way we found it.#
PARIS: Neelix!#
PARIS: Ours?#
PARIS: And you expect to take care of this thing until what? It graduates from high school, college? And what if Mom doesn't come back? Are you planning to bring this with us back on the ship?#
PARIS: Fine. Fine. You made your point. I officially designate you its godfather.#
PARIS: It's shivering. That's normal, isn't it? I mean, new born life forms do shiver, don't they?#
PARIS: Me neither.#
PARIS: It's asleep. Forget what I said, Neelix. You're not its godfather. You're its godmother.#
PARIS: Are you serious? Ugh. I hope I never see another leola root. And you're certainly not feeding any of that hideous broth to my niece. Or nephew. Whatever it is. PARIS: Its heartbeat is getting weaker. I don't like it. Come on, kid. You've got to eat something.#
PARIS: Neelix, it's not your jacket. It's the residue of the trigemic vapours we walked through. Think about it. Voyager's sensors picked up high levels of proteins and amino acids, which we assumed meant this was a planet filled with vast supplies of edible plant life.#
PARIS: The residue is a concentration of proteins and amino acids.#
PARIS: The source we cut off when we blocked the cave. Come on. We've got some rocks to move.#
PARIS: It's just too weak.#
PARIS: Neelix, we did the best we could.#
PARIS: You can't pump it full of drugs without knowing its body chemistry.#
PARIS: Give me that.#
PARIS: When I was a kid, a baby bird fell out of a nest and landed on the windowsill next to my bed. We had to feed it water with an eyedropper to keep it alive.#
PARIS: Filling the eyedropper. Can you hold its mouth open?#
PARIS: Life signs are getting stronger.#
PARIS: We did it. You know, I never would have thought of that hypospray if. The vapours.#
PARIS: Hmm?#
PARIS: No, you don't.#
PARIS: Well, think of it this way. You saved me from having to eat it. Nothing personal, but I just don't have an affinity for hair in my food.#
PARIS: No kidding. What do they say?#
PARIS: Neelix, I told you the truth when I said that nothing happened between me and Kes.#
PARIS: And I promise you nothing ever will. But you weren't wrong about me.#
PARIS: I, well, I guess the only way to say it is to say it. I am attracted to Kes.#
PARIS: To be honest, if you weren't around, I'd be knocking at her door. But I respect you, Neelix. And that's that. Everything you heard those guys saying about me, well, it was true. But it's not who I am anymore. At least not who I want to be. This upside down mission to the wrong side of the galaxy has given me a second chance, and I don't intend to blow it.#
PARIS: She's devoted to you, you know.#
PARIS: Oh, she's a lot more than grateful. She loves you, Neelix. I wouldn't stand a chance. Nobody would.#
PARIS: If you ever doubt yourself, just look into her eyes. See the way she looks at you. You'll never doubt yourself again. And as far as I'm concerned, I'll just be her friend. I mean, if you don't mind.#
PARIS: Voyager? This is Lieutenant Tom Paris and Mister Neelix. Do you read?#
PARIS: Aside from a nasty rash, yes.#
PARIS: What? Why?#
PARIS: Neelix, one thing's for sure. Whether the mother rejects it or not, she will reject you and me.#
PARIS: How long can you give us, Captain?#
PARIS: Lock onto us, Voyager. If you hear muffled screams, consider that a request for a beam out. (Paris and Neelix try to hide, but the approaching adult sees them and growls. Then it turns its attention to the baby.)#
PARIS: Voyager, two to beam out.#
PARIS: I became an uncle.#
PARIS: Cold fowl in a bottle? That's just an expression, isn't it?#
PARIS: Friendly fellow.#
PARIS: They're in a hurry, too. Closing fast.#
PARIS: We have to consider the possibility of cloaked ships.#
PARIS: Aye, sir.#
PARIS: Initiating evasive pattern beta two.#
PARIS: I'm trying.#
PARIS: It's my father.#
PARIS: Sure am, Captain. I'm running the scans on those ships.#
PARIS: Oh, it's not even tempting.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: Let me say something I've always wanted to say. Get out of my life.#
PARIS: Not any more. Not any more.#
PARIS: A plasma leak caught me in the face. Help me.#
PARIS: Come with me.#
PARIS: You can't leave me like this. It hurts.#
PARIS: Kes, please. I can't.#
PARIS: No.#
PARIS: Kes, wait. Come back. Don't leave me! Come back!#
PARIS: Positive, Captain. Harry, check your sensors. That look like some kind of power source to you?#
PARIS: Surface conditions are back to normal, Captain. Winds, two knots. But I can't find any sign of their shuttle. It's not where they landed it.#
PARIS: No, ma'am.#
PARIS: Acknowledged. Beginning entry sequence.#
PARIS: Adjusting flight path.#
PARIS: I'm doing the best I can, Captain. I'm showing gale force winds out there.#
PARIS: Inertial dampers are offline. We seem to be caught in some kind of vortex. I can't maintain altitude.#
PARIS: Altitude, twenty thousand metres and falling. I can't get us out of this thing, Captain.#
PARIS: The ship might make it without inertial dampers, but we'd all just be stains on the back wall.#
PARIS: Altitude at eighteen thousand metres and falling. At this rate, we're looking at about ten minutes.#
PARIS: Would somebody turn that off, please?#
PARIS: We're free. Gaining altitude. Two thousand metres, twenty five hundred. Dampers back online.#
PARIS: Yes, Captain.#
PARIS: I'm picking up sporocystian energy.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Captain, we're picking up an artificial structure on long range sensors. It appears to be a space station of some kind.#
PARIS: We're approaching the station, Captain.#
PARIS: I don't know. It's like the entire molecular structure of the ship is coming apart.#
PARIS: Aye, sir. [Mess hall]#
PARIS: Maybe Starfleet found a way to get a probe here. Maybe they're looking for us.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: We're approaching the beacon's coordinates, Captain.#
PARIS: Aye.  Warp engines are offline, Captain.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Yes, sir.#
PARIS: We'll be in full view of the planet in a few seconds. Orbital sensor net has picked us up. They're scanning the ship. We're being hailed.#
PARIS: If we could beam in close enough to where the away team is being held, we might be able to get in and out of there before the Mokra had a chance to react.#
PARIS: Sounds like they have other things to worry about right now. That disruption might not be accidental. Someone might be trying to get out.#
PARIS: Even if our people didn't cause the problem, you know they'd take advantage of it. This is our best chance to find them.#
PARIS: Understood. [Prison complex] (The prisoners are escaping very quietly.)#
PARIS: Captain.#
PARIS: Very polite, these automated units. [Transporter Room]#
PARIS: Initiating evasive pattern omega six.#
PARIS: Switching evasive pattern to theta one.#
PARIS: Propulsion systems are offline. We're dead in the water.#
PARIS: For a shuttlecraft, it may be.#
PARIS: I don't need a diversion. Just give me a chance, I'll get her out of there.#
PARIS: Your concern for my welfare is heartwarming.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.#
PARIS: Er, if I understand you, Tuvok, that would take me into a direct line of fire with the Cravic ship.#
PARIS: I'm on it. [Pralor vessel]#
PARIS: We're under attack.#
PARIS: By, by, I'm not sure what they are.#
PARIS: Checking. We seem to be tethered to some kind of large plant.#
PARIS: We're back where we started from, Captain.#
PARIS: Not as bad as they hurt us. All engines are offline.#
PARIS: Captain, request permission to give Torres a hand in Engineering. Maybe I can help get propulsion up and running.#
PARIS: She's right. If we went through Seska at least we could ally ourselves with the Nistrim.#
PARIS: The Kazon have him.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Acknowledged. Engaging transwarp drive in four, three, two. Transwarp online. Warp nine point two, nine point three. My vector's drifting.#
PARIS: Got it. Warp nine point six, nine point seven. I'm reading a fracture in the port nacelle pylon.#
PARIS: Warp nine point nine, nine point nine five. I'm approaching the threshold, but the nacelle isn't holding!#
PARIS: It's no use. I'm breaking up! I'm breaking#
PARIS: Great. Do you know anything about quantum warp theory or multi-spectral subspace engine design?#
PARIS: Okay, okay. We'll tell you. We're trying to break the maximum warp barrier.#
PARIS: It means that you would occupy every point in the universe simultaneously. In theory, you could go any place in the wink of an eye. Time and distance would have no meaning.#
PARIS: We discovered a new form of dilithium in the asteroid field we surveyed last month. It remains stable at a much higher warp frequency.#
PARIS: This is a very different problem.#
PARIS: Wait a minute. What about the shuttle itself?#
PARIS: Maybe we've been looking in the wrong place. What if the nacelles aren't being torn from the ship? What if the ship is being torn from the nacelles?#
PARIS: And create a velocity differential. The fuselage would be travelling at a faster rate of speed than the nacelles.#
PARIS: That's it! Neelix, you're a genius.#
PARIS: I'll bring the shuttle up to speed. The second I cross the threshold, I'll cut the engines, drop out of warp and come about.#
PARIS: I kind of like the way that sounds.#
PARIS: Come in. Oh, Captain. I, er#
PARIS: Can I get you anything?#
PARIS: Now, why do I get the feeling this isn't just a social call?#
PARIS: May I ask why?#
PARIS: So?#
PARIS: How big a chance?#
PARIS: Two percent? I'll take that chance.#
PARIS: Yeah, he's capable. That's not the point.#
PARIS: Well, it's hard to explain, but this is my flight.#
PARIS: When I was a boy, my father used to tell me that I was special, that one day I'd do something significant. My teachers at school, all the kids, everyone used to say, Tom Paris is going to do something important when he grows up. Obviously, that didn't happen.#
PARIS: Captain, this is the first time in ten years I feel I have a life to risk.#
PARIS: Captain, I've never been so sure about anything. Please. Please let me make the flight.#
PARIS: Cochrane to Voyager. All systems are nominal. I'm increasing speed.#
PARIS: Warp seven#
PARIS: I'm back.#
PARIS: Oh, yeah. I was, I was staring at the velocity indicator. It said warp ten. And then, as I watched it, I suddenly realised that I was watching myself as well. I could see the outside of the shuttle, I could see Voyager, I could see inside Voyager. I could see inside this room. For a moment, I was everywhere. I mean, everywhere, Captain. With the Kazon, back home, with the Klingons, other galaxies. It was all there. I don't know how else to explain it. It was like. Well, no, it wasn't like anything.#
PARIS: I saw that you were looking for me, so I took the new engines offline and ended up back where I started. But, oh, it's starting to slip away. It all was so vivid, and now#
PARIS: Oh, I'm fine. How's the shuttle?#
PARIS: We should download the shuttle's sensor logs, analyse the telemetry they picked up during the flight before we make another attempt.#
PARIS: You may proceed.#
PARIS: What? Oh! Oh, thanks. That's very flattering.#
PARIS: I wish I could say it was nothing. Oh. Oh, I wish Neelix would name something after me that tasted a little better.#
PARIS: No, trust me. You're taking your life into your hands. So, I think the next step is to try to duplicate the first shuttle flight, verify our results.#
PARIS: But I do think that we should increase the shuttle's memory core by at least#
PARIS: I don't think that coffee is settling too well.#
PARIS: No! No, I've seen enough of the Doctor for one day. Ow! On second thought, maybe I should (Paris tries to stand up, and collapses. Veins are standing out on his temples.)#
PARIS: You're losing me, aren't you? I'm going to die.#
PARIS: Here lies Thomas Eugene Paris, beloved mutant.#
PARIS: Great. Now it'll read, beloved radioactive mutant.#
PARIS: Big funeral with lots of pretty girls all crying. Except Torres. Torres doesn't cry. Did you ever notice that? I don't trust people who don't cry. Of course, my father, he'd say crying is a sign of weakness. I never believed that. Do you cry?#
PARIS: Shame. You know, it's funny. What I remember most about being a kid are the times I spent in my room crying. I liked my room, though. It was quiet in there. People would leave me alone. I'd keep the door locked, read, play games. I lost my virginity in that room. Seventeen. Parents were away for the weekend.#
PARIS: Ow!#
PARIS: Pepperoni! God, I'd love a pepperoni pizza with Kavarian olives right now. I'm starving!#
PARIS: Kiss me.#
PARIS: Not you. Her.#
PARIS: Consider it a last request.#
PARIS: Oh, what's the difference? I'm dying anyway. Do me a favour. When I'm gone, call Starfleet Headquarters and tell Dad that I did it. Tell him#
PARIS: What's happening?#
PARIS: What?#
PARIS: Pretty disgusting, huh?#
PARIS: Like a lab experiment gone wrong.#
PARIS: Why?#
PARIS: Why? What I'm becoming will probably be better than who I was.#
PARIS: Oh, yes, it is. Admit it. Part of you will be glad to see me gone. I'm the Maquis traitor who sits on your Bridge and insults your uniform, remember?#
PARIS: No, you're not. You're trying to take this away from me.#
PARIS: What I'm becoming. How do you know this isn't good for me? How do you know this isn't the best thing that's ever happened to me?#
PARIS: You're lying. Just like him. Just like everyone around here. Always lying. Always telling me that I'm doing a good job, that you're glad I'm on this ship. But none of that's true. Why can't you just say it? You're jealous that I broke the transwarp barrier, and now you're hoping I'll die!#
PARIS: Wait, Captain. I'm sorry. Please come back. I know you're doing what you can. It's just, I'm scared. I didn't mean to lash out at you.#
PARIS: I know you are. And I know you'll fail!#
PARIS: You know, I used to look up to you. But now you seem so small, so insignificant. You don't even know what, what, what#
PARIS: Doctor!#
PARIS: I need to talk.#
PARIS: Urgent. Yes, urgent. Let me out of here.#
PARIS: Please. I can't stay here. I have to get off this ship.#
PARIS: I understand. It's all so clear now.#
PARIS: The present, the past, they're both in the future. The future is in the past.#
PARIS: Listen to me! I am more. I'm everything. Let me go.#
PARIS: I can't! Please. Please!#
PARIS: Captain, er#
PARIS: Captain, I'm sorry. I, I don't know what to say, except I don't remember very much about, er, you know#
PARIS: Thank you, Captain.#
PARIS: I don't know. I guess this whole experience has left me feeling a little overwhelmed. Flying at warp ten, evolving into a new life form, mating, having alien offspring.#
PARIS: Breaking the threshold. It was incredible. But somehow it doesn't mean as much as I thought it would.#
PARIS: I guess I went into this looking for a quick fix. I thought making history would change things. Not just my service record, my reputation.#
PARIS: Yeah. But I'm starting to realise that it's not other people's opinions I should be worried about. It's mine. It seems, Captain, that I still have a few barriers to break. I just hope they're not theoretical impossibilities.#
PARIS: Why don't we make it interesting this time. Let's add some table stakes.#
PARIS: I don't know. Hmm. Couple of replicator rations, maybe?#
PARIS: That would be dishonest, Harry.#
PARIS: How many rations are you willing to bet on that?#
PARIS: Harry, Harry, Harry. Never, ever play with anyone, not even your best friend, if he says let's make it interesting. You want a little action, I'll give you a little action. How about an honest game of chance?#
PARIS: One replicator ration is all it takes to play, and the only thing you have to do to win is pick a number. Just predict what the radiogenic particle count will be at twelve hundred hours tomorrow, and if you hit the pot is yours. Minus a small handling fee for the bank, of course.#
PARIS: And the winner of sixteen replicator rations in the Paris radiogenic sweepstakes is? Computer?#
PARIS: What? No winner? Computer, are you positive?#
PARIS: You heard the little lady. Try your luck again, folks. The pot grows daily until we have a winner. Enter your name on the PADD and pick a number. Can I buy you lunch, Mister Kim? I have an extra ration today.#
PARIS: I think I'll have some prime rib, medium rare, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and maybe some Yorkshire pudding. And a Raktajino with whipped cream on it. [Ready room]#
PARIS: And the winner is? Computer? Computer?#
PARIS: Oh come on, Chakotay. We're just having a little fun. The recreational facilities of the Delta Quadrant being what they are.#
PARIS: I didn't think Starfleet would have a problem with it.#
PARIS: Now there's a tough job, filling out reports. But somebody's got to do it.#
PARIS: Sorry.#
PARIS: And what are we going to do with it once we find it?#
PARIS: Yes, sir.#
PARIS: You were afraid he'd say no.#
PARIS: Your voice?#
PARIS: I don't blame you.#
PARIS: You took a risk. You were thinking like a Maquis. That was a whole different life.#
PARIS: You know, I've been surprised at how well you've been able to fit in here. A little envious too.#
PARIS: Going on? How?#
PARIS: Are they? People like who? Chakotay?#
PARIS: The Lieutenant was unhappy that my conn. reports weren't punctuated properly, according to Starfleet protocol. I didn't like his attitude.#
PARIS: We're in the Delta quadrant, nowhere near Starfleet. What difference? Yeah, he was right. I'm the one who's been wrong. Wrong about a lot of things. Why don't we try running a multi-phasic sweep?#
PARIS: I'm on it.#
PARIS: It's increasing speed to warp nine.#
PARIS: It's still on course for the planet at warp nine.#
PARIS: Captain, it's maintaining course and speed.#
PARIS: When a bomb starts talking about itself in the third person, I get worried.#
PARIS: I'm not getting any response from the warp or impulse drives. Even the manoeuvring thrusters are out.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Another group of fighters are starting an attack run.#
PARIS: The Rakosan vessels are withdrawing, Captain.#
PARIS: The starboard thrusters are a little sluggish. Ease into them.#
PARIS: Captain, thanks for everything.#
PARIS: Come in.#
PARIS: Neelix! How's it going? Not good, it looks like. What's wrong?#
PARIS: Good news travels fast, I guess. Yeah, I figured there was quite a bit more opportunity for advancement on a Talaxian convoy than there was on the only Starfleet ship in the quadrant.#
PARIS: Truthfully? About a minute and a half after I set foot on this ship a year ago. I knew it was a mistake to try to fit into Starfleet again, and I should have listened to myself. A few more months in that rehab colony would have been a hell of a lot better than being here.#
PARIS: Neelix, no. This isn't about anybody except me. I've done this to myself, just like always. No matter where I go or who I'm with, I make a mess of things. The unmistakable conclusion has to be that deep down, I don't want any friends, or a family, or a home. Otherwise, I wouldn't keep sabotaging the possibilities.#
PARIS: I tried. Or maybe I just told myself I was trying. I'm not sure. Either way, it's just not working. Frankly, I'd like to get out before I completely destroy my image. There might actually be one or two people who still have a good opinion of me.#
PARIS: Well, I thank you. But the truth is, I've always considered myself a drifter. You know what that's like, Neelix. Freedom to do what you want, when you want. No rules to follow, nobody depending on you, right?#
PARIS: Hello, Seska. You're looking radiantly maternal.#
PARIS: I wouldn't know.#
PARIS: It's not sudden. I never really fit in there.#
PARIS: No. No, it was me trying very hard to be someone I finally couldn't be.#
PARIS: I can assure you the feeling is mutual.#
PARIS: Is that why you kidnapped me and dragged me here, so we could be pals now?#
PARIS: And if it doesn't?#
PARIS: What exactly would that mean?#
PARIS: It seems to me like you're already getting a lot of valuable information about Voyager from somewhere.#
PARIS: No. Lieutenant Paris is in fact part of our plan.#
PARIS: Clever plan, Seska, leading Voyager into an ambush. But even so, this ship will be outmanned and outgunned.#
PARIS: Thanks for the hospitality.#
PARIS: Paris to Voyager. Paris to Voyager! Do you read me yet? Paris to Voyager!#
PARIS: I can take care of myself.#
PARIS: I'm here, Captain!#
PARIS: Captain, the spy, it's Michael Jonas.#
PARIS: I'd like to say something more, if I might.#
PARIS: Er, I know that I've been acting like a jerk for the last couple of months. Unfortunately, I had to behave that way if the spy was going to believe that I really wanted to leave the ship. So, I'd like to apologise to anyone that I might have offended. Especially Commander Chakotay. I gave him a pretty hard time. Not that it wasn't a certain amount of fun, mind you.#
PARIS: Sorry I'm late, but I have a very good excuse. Picture this. I'm just getting ready to leave the Mess hall, when Ensign Wildman goes into labour. What else could I do but deliver the baby? Oh, you should've been there, Harry. There is nothing like bringing a new life into the world. I think I missed my calling. What if I told you the turbolift got stuck on deck six?#
PARIS: It won't happen again.#
PARIS: Or maybe it's some kind of trick.#
PARIS: Excuse me?#
PARIS: Oh, no offence, Commander, but why this sudden concern for my feelings?#
PARIS: Yeah, I've got a problem. My problem is you.#
PARIS: You tell me I don't take my job seriously. But half the time, you don't let me do my job.#
PARIS: It means that you don't trust my judgement. You don't allow me to take initiative. Remember last week? I suggested that we might save time by travelling through that emissions nebula. But what did you say? Oh no, that's not the way we do things on this ship.#
PARIS: Being a leader also means knowing when to give your people a little leeway and let them be creative. I might as well put this ship on autopilot for all the freedom you give me to do my job.#
PARIS: Yeah, well, I know you don't put much stock in my opinion. So maybe you should talk to some of these people, because I'm not the only one around here who's got a problem with you. Now, if there's nothing else, sir, I'd like to be excused.#
PARIS: Oh. Well, pull up a chair.#
PARIS: Oh, thanks a lot, Doc.#
PARIS: Why the sudden interest in romance?#
PARIS: Ah. All right. Well, let's see. Sometimes there's not a lot you can do to get over a woman you really care about. I remember when Susie Crabtree dumped me back in my first year at the Academy. I broke out in hives. Couldn't get out of bed for a week. I almost failed Stellar Cartography. I walked around in a daze for the rest of that year. Of course, the first one is always the hardest to get over.#
PARIS: But, eventually, you start thinking about her less and less. Until finally, without realising it, she's not on your mind anymore.#
PARIS: For the most part. But every now and then, even years later, something reminds you of her. A certain smell, a few notes of a song, and suddenly you feel just as bad as the day she told you she never wanted to see you again. If you want to know the honest truth, Doc, you never completely get over a woman you really cared about. Wait a minute, Doc. We're not talking about you, are we?#
PARIS: Oh. Boy, you've got it bad. Look, Doc, I don't mean to intrude, but if you tell me what's going on, maybe I can help.#
PARIS: Your approach is all wrong.#
PARIS: Women like romance. They want men to make an effort, take them someplace special.#
PARIS: Come with me, Doc. I've got an idea. Doctor's personal log, stardate 49504.3. Inaugural entry. Kes and Mister Paris have conspired to get Denara and me alone together in a place Paris considers romantic. I've never felt more uneasy.#
PARIS: But it's my shift.#
PARIS: What, because I was ten minutes late?#
PARIS: Captain.#
PARIS: So, when should I report back for duty?#
PARIS: Get your hands off me!#
PARIS: This is ridiculous. It's been seven hours. How long does it take to deliver a baby?#
PARIS: There's a large plasma drift bearing four zero mark seven. It extends almost half the length of this sector. Interference from the plasma should block us from their sensors.#
PARIS: What the hell? Captain, the warp engines just stalled.#
PARIS: Impulse engines aren't responding. Manoeuvring thrusters are out too.#
PARIS: Are you all right, Captain?#
PARIS: It's more than a scratch. Maybe you should go to#
PARIS: Right.#
PARIS: If it is true, what do we do about it?#
PARIS: I'll let the Doctor know he'll have to rely on his back up power supply.#
PARIS: They're Vidiian, sir. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] (Kim nods.)#
PARIS: I'm not picking up their shuttle on sensors.#
PARIS: I'm reading one on heading one five one mark eight.#
PARIS: And another one on a divergent course twenty degrees to starboard.#
PARIS: We could generate the same kind of field with a shuttle's warp coils.#
PARIS: It might be a rough ride, but we can make it.#
PARIS: Shields, phasers, inertial dampers, comm. system.#
PARIS: Or we could just skip pre-flight altogether.#
PARIS: I'll remember that. I've taken the warp drive offline. Setting up the dielectric field. It's holding, but we'll have to keep an eye on the stabiliser integrity.#
PARIS: Captain, I'm picking up a Drayan shuttle. They're on an intercept course.#
PARIS: The dielectric field is weakening our structural integrity. If we go much faster I'm afraid we'll break up. We're improvising here, the Drayans aren't.#
PARIS: We'll be testing that theory in a few seconds. They're about to enter weapons range, Captain.#
PARIS: Let's hope the ones on the surface feel the same way. We'll be through this ionosphere in a few more minutes.#
PARIS: We should be close enough to get a comm. signal through.#
PARIS: Tuvok, can your shuttle make it back to Voyager? Maybe we should wait for you.#
PARIS: Obviously, Ensign Baytart doesn't appreciate music.#
PARIS: This ship was built for combat performance, Harry, not musical performance. Nobody figured we'd be taking any long trips.#
PARIS: How about the cargo bay?#
PARIS: We could get Baytart transferred to the night shift.#
PARIS: So now you have an excuse to give your mother why you didn't practice while you were gone.#
PARIS: Oh, really? Are we scheduled to rendezvous with the Delta Quadrant Symphony Orchestra?#
PARIS: Lieutenant Nicoletti? The one I've been chasing for six months? Cold hands, cold heart?#
PARIS: You know, Harry, I've always wanted to learn how to play the drums.#
PARIS: Did anyone survive?#
PARIS: Maybe they saw it coming and evacuated the planet.#
PARIS: Looks like they didn't make it.#
PARIS: Maybe they like it in there.#
PARIS: How can we do that? Implant a com-link into their brains?#
PARIS: Ten minutes and all the hostages could be killed.#
PARIS: Our scans of the planet's surface and atmosphere don't show anything out of the ordinary.#
PARIS: Yes, ma'am, but I'd recommend waiting until morning. The weather on the planet can get pretty nasty at night.#
PARIS: Here you go. One prize-winning chrysanthemum, one garden-variety clematis, and last but not least, one symbiogenetic alien orchid.#
PARIS: We've created a monster.#
PARIS: Warp six point five.#
PARIS: Commander?#
PARIS: But you're captain now. You can rescind them.#
PARIS: Type nine shuttlecraft has a top speed of warp four. It won't take them more than, oh, about seven hundred years to get home.#
PARIS: I guess clearly something you can't do, which is to feel as rotten about this as we do.#
PARIS: Harry.#
PARIS: I'm reading a second ship, one seven seven mark five.#
PARIS: They're surrounding us!#
PARIS: Shields down to forty seven percent. Sir, there're just too many of them.#
PARIS: They're still coming.#
PARIS: Understood.#
PARIS: Ready to go to warp, sir.#
PARIS: Aye, aye, sir. [Outside the shelter] (Janeway is tending some quite mature seedlings in a vegetable plot. She and Chakotay have stopped wearing their comm. badges.)#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Negative. Tracking the source. Seems like it's coming from an unmanned buoy, coordinates one four zero mark three one seven.#
PARIS: That's good for about forty hours if we average warp two. After that we're out of their comm. range.#
PARIS: We'll just do it with mirrors.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Nothing on long range sensors. The raider is continuing to retreat. We should have a couple of hours to ourselves at least.#
PARIS: Captain, we're about to go beyond the comm. range of the Talaxian colony. Just thought you'd like to know.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: I'm doing my best.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Eight minutes. Their attack formation is a classic Cardassian echelon.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: Three minutes, ten seconds, give or take a photon torpedo.#
PARIS: Confirmed. They're changing course.#
PARIS: Two minutes to intercept.#
PARIS: Thirty seconds to intercept.#
PARIS: Engaging impulse engines.#
PARIS: Initiating evasive manoeuvres, beta sequence.#
PARIS: Coming about, one four one mark two zero.#
PARIS: Coming about.#
PARIS: I just repaired the acceleration sensors.#
PARIS: Signature?#
PARIS: Damn it! I don't have time for this.#
PARIS: I don't have time for this! Computer, all stop. Engage impulse.#
PARIS: I told you, I don't have time for this.#
PARIS: Is there any word on the crew?#
PARIS: If you can help me with repairs, we can be on our way in a few hours.#
PARIS: Commander Paxim, my people are counting on you. Look, no one knows Voyager like I do. I know every vulnerability, every blind spot. Don't worry. I have a plan.#
PARIS: One hour. I should be able to come up with some kind of plan in one hour.#
PARIS: Go ahead.#
PARIS: Acknowledged. Ready and waiting. I just hope you are too, Doc. [Planet surface]#
PARIS: Here we go.#
PARIS: Yes, Doc, yes! Paris to Commander Paxim. Stand by. I'm going to start transporting your people to Voyager.#
PARIS: Forget them. We have more important things to do. [Planet surface] (The chief places a leaf containing other herbs on Wildman's baby's chest. She stops crying.)#
PARIS: I had a lot of help. The Talaxians, the Doc, Mister Suder.#
PARIS: No, he and the Doctor sabotaged the ship. Suder disabled the phasers before they killed him.#
PARIS: Heading four one, mark seven seven. Destination, Alpha Quadrant.#
PARIS: Approaching the last known co-ordinates of the wormhole, Captain.#
PARIS: This is where we picked up a replicator signature?#
PARIS: He's got a point. We have never heard the Song of the Sages more beautifully recited.#
PARIS: Excuse me?#
PARIS: No, thank you. We're not planning on settling here.#
PARIS: I'm sorry, but we're really not interested.#
PARIS: Excuse me.#
PARIS: Then I'd say the temple's where we ought to look.#
PARIS: Look, friend, I thought I told you#
PARIS: And let me guess. It just so happens that you could sell us a couple of these ears.#
PARIS: And my feet are now cold.#
PARIS: Don't push your luck.#
PARIS: You know, so far, I can't say that I like this town very much. (A large gong is struck four times, then the temple door opens and young women in spangly bikinis and thin veils walk out and stand behind two thrones.) PARIS: On the other hand.#
PARIS: But these Ferengi are anything but benevolent.#
PARIS: Of course, being Ferengi, they haven't just co-opted the mythology. They've cornered the market on everything.#
PARIS: Apparently it wasn't always like that. According to the people that we met, before the Ferengi came, the society may have been primitive, but it was flourishing. What I'd like to know is how two Ferengi got to the Delta Quadrant.#
PARIS: But how do we get two Ferengi to just walk away from a monopoly on an entire economy?#
PARIS: Profit.#
PARIS: Looks like Neelix is pulling off quite a performance.#
PARIS: Oh, great.#
PARIS: But we didn't ask you to recite it.#
PARIS: Look, friend, I'm sorry about your eye, really, but. Wait a minute. Wasn't your patch on the other side?#
PARIS: We've got to go.#
PARIS: Did you hear that? The Holy Pilgrim!#
PARIS: The Holy Pilgrim!#
PARIS: Lead them back! Lead them back!#
PARIS: That's our cue.#
PARIS: We've got to disable the dampening field so they can beam us out of here. Where's the generator?#
PARIS: I can't shut it down.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain.#
PARIS: They're setting a course for the planet, Captain.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. Resetting the co-ordinates.#
PARIS: Adjusting course to follow. It's too fast for us, Captain. I need more speed.#
PARIS: It's not enough.#
PARIS: Aye, Captain. [Town square] (The crowd watch Voyager zoom across the sky.)#
