TORRES:  A fuel line has ruptured. Attempting to compensate. Damn it! We're barely maintaining impulse. I can't get any more out of it.#
TORRES: How am I supposed to be creative with a thirty nine year old rebuilt engine?#
TORRES: Take the weapons offline. We'll transfer all power to the engines.#
TORRES: What does it matter? We're not making a dent in their shields anyway! You wanted creative.#
TORRES: We'll find out.#
TORRES: No! (She leaps off the bed, pushes the doctor away and tries to force open the door. The nurse summons help as Torres beats up the doctor. Two medics enter and hold her as the doctor gives her a hypo to knock her out again.) Captain's log, stardate 48315.6. We've traced the energy pulses from the array to the fifth planet of the neighbouring system and believe they may have been used in some fashion to transport Kim and Torres to the planet's surface.#
TORRES: Who are you?#
TORRES: What was Starfleet doing at that array?#
TORRES: You mean you were trying to capture us.#
TORRES: I don't find this at all amusing, Starfleet.#
TORRES: What are they doing to us? What are these things growing on us?#
TORRES: You're right, Starfleet. It's the Klingon half of me. It's just it's hard to control it sometimes.#
TORRES: B'Elanna. B'Elanna Torres.#
TORRES: Why are you holding us here?#
TORRES: But before that, you lived on the surface?#
TORRES: Does the Caretaker provide your meals too?#
TORRES: Their protection?#
TORRES: We weren't sick until we met your Caretaker.#
TORRES: There have been others? Like us?#
TORRES: Where are they?#
TORRES: What makes you think any of them are still alive?#
TORRES: No.#
TORRES: Are you watching us? I thought we weren't supposed to be your prisoners.#
TORRES: What do you say?#
TORRES: Can you get us tools to dig with?#
TORRES: Come on. Don't let it beat you, Starfleet. Come on.#
TORRES: All right. It's all right. We'll rest a minute.#
TORRES: Trust me, it's more trouble than it's worth.#
TORRES: We're not finished yet. I know a few things that old Sneezy didn't teach in his survival course.#
TORRES: Commander Zakarian, remember? He must have been allergic to everything.#
TORRES: Actually made it into the second year before we, er, we mutually agreed that it wasn't the place for me.#
TORRES: Shush. Listen. They're getting faster.#
TORRES: Neither of us has enough fire power to stop that ship.#
TORRES: What do you think you're doing? That Array is the only way we have to get back home.#
TORRES: What other way home is there? Who is she to be making these decisions for all of us?#
TORRES: Argh!#
TORRES: What's this?#
TORRES: Lieutenant Carey is an idiot! When I tell you what happened#
TORRES: I didn't even come close to hitting him that hard.#
TORRES: So how long do I have to stay in here?#
TORRES: I've never found your twisted sense of humour very funny, Chakotay.#
TORRES: Apologise? He was the one who#
TORRES: I am not going to bond with him.#
TORRES: I don't need support from anybody.#
TORRES: Huh. Right.#
TORRES: But Carey is next in line.#
TORRES: What does the Captain have to say about this?#
TORRES: Damn it! The new relays on the power grid aren't holding.#
TORRES: I can't shut it down. The emitter relays are locked.#
TORRES: You asked to see me, Captain?#
TORRES: I just want you to know that I have personally gone over every emitter relay again and refitted four of them myself.#
TORRES: Well, er, we've, er, we've been through a few scrapes together.#
TORRES: Ready?#
TORRES: Well, I think I know my way around an engine room, if that's what you mean.#
TORRES: I'm not bothered by what people think of me.#
TORRES: Listen, Captain, if you don't think I'm right for this job, just say so.#
TORRES: Where did you get that?#
TORRES: Yeah, I guess you could say that.#
TORRES: The problem? The problem was a system that didn't give anyone a chance to breathe.#
TORRES: Then I guess maybe this is just a bad idea.#
TORRES: I didn't want to have anything to do with Starfleet then, and I'm sorry that I have to now.#
TORRES: Oh. Well, I'll give you a full report on what happens.#
TORRES: Yes.#
TORRES: But it won't work. I mean, it was a good idea to try it but it won't work.#
TORRES: I was just thinking about the problem with the Doctor's holographic projectors. It seems like the spatial distortions might be interfering with the projectors phase alignment.#
TORRES: If that's the case, I could screen out those distortions by setting up a localised dampening field around the projectors.#
TORRES: My point is, that if the spatial distortions are also interfering with the transmission we received from the other ship#
TORRES: Exactly. And they may know more about what's going on than we do.#
TORRES: Ramping up field intensity.#
TORRES: I'm applying the damping field to our visual scanners. I'll see if I can clarify the image.#
TORRES: No, that's not it. I think I have an explanation. [Briefing room]#
TORRES: Think of it like this. You're sitting at the bottom of a pond, which is frozen over, and you look up at the surface and you see a reflection of yourself. Now, you might think you're looking at another person sitting at the bottom of another pond, looking back at you.#
TORRES: Unfortunately, yes.#
TORRES: I'm not sure. But I do know one thing. That as we slide deeper into the singularity, the spatial distortions are increasing. According to my calculations, within nine hours, they'll crush the ship.#
TORRES: Look for a crack.#
TORRES: Wait a minute. What if we've already made a crack in the ice?#
TORRES: If we could find our entry point, we might be able to slip out the way we came in.#
TORRES: Anything?#
TORRES: Oh, it's too small. It must have collapsed since we first passed through it.#
TORRES: Put a wedge in it and force it open. We could try a dekyon beam.#
TORRES: Shields at full strength.#
TORRES: Remodulating emitters. Captain, I want to apologise for losing my temper in your Ready room. I think maybe you were hitting a little bit too close to home, you know? I respect Chakotay but he's wrong. I'm not officer material and we both know it. The truth is, I quit the Academy because I realised I couldn't make it in Starfleet, and believe me, no one was sorry to see me go.#
TORRES: What?#
TORRES: I fought with him almost every day. I was always questioning his, his methods, his assumptions, and he was always slapping me down like some upstart kid. I was surprised he didn't help me pack my bags.#
TORRES: Dekyon beam online.  Shields down to sixty two percent.#
TORRES: We're losing power. I don't think we're going to get any more, Captain.#
TORRES: Well, this is a problem.#
TORRES: Captain, the rupture is starting to collapse again. If Voyager doesn't get through it within the next five minutes, they'll never get out.#
TORRES: Simple choice. Port or starboard?#
TORRES: Port. The port ship is more likely to be the real one. It's closer to the rupture. That means,#
TORRES: That means they're holding position as close as they can to the rupture, waiting for us to dock before they head out.#
TORRES: There has to be some way to tell them apart besides which direction they're facing.#
TORRES: Then I was right. It's the port ship. They're heading out.#
TORRES: If you're wrong, we're going to have a long time to debate it.#
TORRES: We're ready to dock.#
TORRES: That's too narrow. We're not going to make it.#
TORRES: I'll try not to break any of their noses.#
TORRES: Thirteen hundred? That's impossible.#
TORRES: All right. Get that isolinear bank up and running. And lock down those plasma relays. Please. I'm going to be counting on you, Lieutenant. I'm not up to date on the latest Starfleet protocols and I know that you're probably more familiar with the quirks of this warp engine than I am right now. I hope that I can depend on you.#
TORRES: The entire surface of the planet was just seared.#
TORRES: They're gone. Vaporised. Every organic has basically been obliterated.#
TORRES: Chaltok Four?#
TORRES: So, we're looking at the end of a war.#
TORRES: Polaric ion concentrations are so high I can't get an accurate reading.#
TORRES: A civilisation powered by polaric ion energy?#
TORRES: What?#
TORRES: Your central nervous system is showing a temporal flux, but it's rapidly returning to normal.#
TORRES: Shockwaves from most explosions dissipate into the future, but we're speculating, based in part on what Paris told us he saw, that these dissipate into the past.#
TORRES: He wasn't all the way inside a fracture, remember? We still saw Paris standing there even when he could see the other side.#
TORRES: There's no way for us to measure exactly how far back these fractures go.#
TORRES: Once we've identified where and when they re, then we have to widen the fracture at that point.#
TORRES: This device uses the same polaric energy that destroyed the planet.#
TORRES: If we can locate them, this is capable of bringing them back.#
TORRES: Not at the same location. Once we make an attempt at any given location, the damage to subspace will make a second attempt impossible.#
TORRES: We've modified our tricorders to detect the fractures, and all of us will be wearing one of these.#
TORRES: It puts out an anti-polaric field. It should repel the fractures when they get within three metres.#
TORRES: That probably indicates the subspace damage is beginning to dissipate. If that's true, it's going to be harder to locate Tom and the Captain.#
TORRES: I guess it means they were caught in the explosion.#
TORRES: Initiating microscanner for subspace fracture.#
TORRES: At this point we're suggesting we concentrate our search at the flash-point.#
TORRES: We already have.#
TORRES: This was undoubtedly the flash-point of the explosion. Whatever went wrong, it started here.#
TORRES: Scanning for the subspace beacon. It doesn't look like they were here.#
TORRES: There's no way we could pin-point the exact time we'd be penetrating but we could make an educated guess.#
TORRES: Commander?#
TORRES: I don't understand. It's not working. We're not penetrating the fracture. (The wormhole is defeated by Janeway's phaser, blowing the away team backwards in slow motion. All the crewmembers disappear from the planet surface.)#
TORRES: It also looks like there's a series of subterranean caves with an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.#
TORRES: It's hard to get a precise reading. It could be anywhere from five hundred to one thousand metric tonnes.#
TORRES: It'll be ready to go in three days.#
TORRES: The amount of information this thing can gather puts a tricorder to shame. You fire this at someone, you learn everything about their anatomy, right down to their DNA sequencing.#
TORRES: Compensate with the KLS stabiliser.#
TORRES: Some kind of power drain. I can't localise it but we're losing power at the rate of#
TORRES: No effect, Captain.#
TORRES: Captain, I didn't realise there was an inspection scheduled.#
TORRES: We should have the warp drive up and running by oh nine hundred hours. Recalibrating the reactant injectors is the only thing we have left to do.#
TORRES: Computer, activate Emergency Medical Holographic Programme.#
TORRES: Why do you always have to say that?#
TORRES: Under the circumstances, don't you think you really ought to change your programme?#
TORRES: I know a little about holographic programming. I could probably reprogram you.#
TORRES: Has anyone ever told you, you have a lousy attitude?#
TORRES: I need a second opinion on this.#
TORRES: I gave it to myself. It's a sample of residue we picked up in a nebula.#
TORRES: The molecules are isolinear. No polycyclic structures, but#
TORRES: Is it some kind of phosopholipid fibre?#
TORRES: I hope that you have better luck with yours than I had with mine.#
TORRES: I'm sorry to interrupt, but the Doctor and I have come up with a rather surprising analysis of the matter left on the hull. It's organic.#
TORRES: That's not what I mean. The samples are clearly organic elements of a much larger life form. It appears, Captain, that this nebula is not a nebula at all.#
TORRES: That would be right here.#
TORRES: I do?#
TORRES: If the life form has a nucleogenic structure, nucleonic radiation ought to assist its healing process. A nucleonic beam along the edges of the breach should theoretically promote regeneration.#
TORRES: Acknowledged. Cutting thrusters.#
TORRES: We're ready#
TORRES: How does that help us?#
TORRES: That's right.#
TORRES: Standing by.#
TORRES: Paris, did you program this guy?#
TORRES: He's a pig, and so are you.#
TORRES: I've been monitoring it from Engineering. It's still embedded in a gravitational eddy, but within seventy two hours it will be crushed.#
TORRES: I'll give you a hand.#
TORRES: I'm on it. Just a few minutes more.#
TORRES: We haven't been gone that long. People won't give up on us so soon. They probably just think we're lost.#
TORRES: Well, it is going to work, Starfleet, so pretty soon they're going to know you're all right.#
TORRES: I haven't seen my father since I was five. He and my mother separated. He went back to Earth and that was the last I saw of him.#
TORRES: I think she's on the Klingon Homeworld.#
TORRES: We didn't get along very well. Okay, the signal generator should be tuned to the probe's long range sensors.#
TORRES: The Maquis are as to a close family as I've ever had. Most of my friends are here, on the ship, so no, there's no one back home who's going to care one way or the other whether I'm alive. We're ready to transmit.#
TORRES: It's too soon. Remember, we have no idea how long it takes to reach the other side.#
TORRES: I'm still worried about the gravitational interference. I don't think the co-variant isolator will be effective with a vocal transmission.#
TORRES: I'll narrow the filter bandpass some more. Try again, Captain.#
TORRES: Just our luck. We raise one ship from the Alpha quadrant and it has to be Romulan.#
TORRES: Captain, I have to talk to you.#
TORRES: No. I mean, in private. [Ready room] TORRES: The phase amplitude of the visual link with the Romulan ship is within just a few megahertz of meeting transporter protocols.#
TORRES: We might be able to piggyback a transporter beam onto the visual link. We could transport the entire crew back to the Alpha quadrant.#
TORRES: Fairly substantially.#
TORRES: We'll have to run a series of tests first.#
TORRES: I'll need some help.#
TORRES: We're locked onto him. Whenever you're ready, Captain.#
TORRES: It's the phase variance in the radiation stream. I'm balancing it manually.#
TORRES: For a while there I didn't think you were going make it. There was a strange phase variance in the radiation stream. It almost kept us from pulling you through.#
TORRES: The signal's in the pattern buffer. Transferring to the emitter array.#
TORRES: Compensating. Transport complete, Captain. He made it.#
TORRES: Maybe he left a will telling someone else to transmit the messages. Or he could have given our computer chip to the Romulan Government.#
TORRES: I'm with you. Blowing out the dorsal phase emitters. Torres to Engineering.#
TORRES: Vent a couple of LN2 exhaust conduits along the dorsal emitters. Make it look like we're in serious trouble.#
TORRES: Engines off-line.#
TORRES: Can you imagine what we could make with this stuff? Probe casings that could go into the core of a sun, ultra-thin reactor shielding.#
TORRES: Or better yet, maybe we could get a firsthand look at this element in its natural environment. It looks like most of these asteroids support Class M atmospheres.#
TORRES: It's organic. Some kind of biopolymer residue.#
TORRES: Well, I think I've found out about all I can with my eyes.#
TORRES: They like to bury their dead on asteroids. That's about all I can tell without a tricorder. No artefacts, no inscriptions, just some naked dead people.#
TORRES: The Klingons believe in an afterlife, but there's no burial ritual. They just dispose of the corpse by the most efficient means possible.#
TORRES: This isn't one of the bodies we found in the cavern. It's someone else.#
TORRES: Wait a minute. I'm showing signs of electrical activity in the brain. It looks like she died just a few minutes ago. We might be able to revive her. If we can, we might get some answers.#
TORRES: What do you suggest we do, Commander? Kim's gone. She's the only one who might be able to tell us what happened.#
TORRES: The vacuoles are disrupting the warp core's magnetic interlocks. It won't be long before we lose antimatter containment.#
TORRES: No. The magnetic interlocks have stabilised. I think we're safe out here.#
TORRES: Aye, Captain. [Mess hall]#
TORRES: Wait a minute, Captain. Maybe there is a way to send Ptera home and find Ensign Kim at the same time.#
TORRES: What if we recreated the transporter accident? If it's true that Harry was pulled through the vacuole during transport, we might be able to reproduce those circumstances and send Ptera home.#
TORRES: Right.#
TORRES: The field is fluctuating slightly, but holding.#
TORRES: Another vacuole. Deck fifteen.#
TORRES: The dampening field's down to twenty one percent. The interlocks won't hold much longer. I recommend leaving, Captain.#
TORRES: What?#
TORRES: I happen to know that Murphy is seeing one of the Delaney sisters.#
TORRES: Harry and the Delaney sisters? He would have told me.#
TORRES: Harry, is it true about you and the Delaney sisters?#
TORRES: Harry, we're your friends. You can tell us.#
TORRES: Forty thousand light years. Even if that's as far as we could go, it would still knock about four decades off our trip.#
TORRES: He's right, maybe they can be reasoned with.#
TORRES: In the meantime, I'm going to take a look at that trajector platform. Maybe I can figure out how it works.#
TORRES: I just hope she gets it.#
TORRES: You looked a million light years away.#
TORRES: I've been thinking. The folding of space should leave a sub-space residue. If we can detect one, we might be a step closer to knowing how the trajector works.#
TORRES: Maybe. If the device creates a neutrino bubble around whatever's being trajectored.#
TORRES: Let's give it a try. In theory, of course.#
TORRES: Maybe she will. After all, it's a Sikarian who's making the offer.#
TORRES: Somehow, I have a bad feeling about this. It's just not going to work out.#
TORRES: What does that mean?#
TORRES: Take the technology? Without permission?#
TORRES: Seska, I am a senior officer now. I have responsibilities.#
TORRES: We're under orders.#
TORRES: All right, let's do it. [Transporter room] TORRES: Why would anyone do that?#
TORRES: Are you crazy? Security will find you out before you get there.#
TORRES: You were going to download it?#
TORRES: We're ready now, Captain.#
TORRES: He'll be here. We certainly won't leave without him.#
TORRES: Calm down. You're going to draw attention to yourself.#
TORRES: What are you doing? He said not to activate it!#
TORRES: All right. But just a simulation.#
TORRES: I'll show you. Sikaris has a mantle of tetrahedral quartz twenty kilometres thick. The crystalline structure of the mantle seems to focus and amplify the trajector field.#
TORRES: We don't have time to test it. We'll have to try it now, or forget it.#
TORRES: If there are any compatibility problems#
TORRES: Torres here.#
TORRES: We've got a phase variance in plasma conduit three. I'll have to check it out before we can engage thrusters.#
TORRES: That's the effect of the quartz mantle.#
TORRES: The plasma manifold is becoming unstable.#
TORRES: They must be the catalyst for the space-folding process.#
TORRES: We're on it, Captain. No time to talk. Shut down the matrix!#
TORRES: Carey, get everybody out!#
TORRES: I can't unlock it! The command matrix is sealed.#
TORRES: We didn't anticipate anti-neutrinos. The trajector could never be compatible with Federation technology.#
TORRES: No! We're not going to cover this up.#
TORRES: But we're going to. We disobeyed orders, gambling that it would pay off. It didn't. And now we just can't pretend that nothing happened.#
TORRES: I'm sorry if you don't get it, Seska, but it has something to do with, er, with being able to live with yourself.#
TORRES: If that's true, I take it as a compliment. [Ready room] TORRES: Yes, Ma'am.#
TORRES: What could do something like this?#
TORRES: Does something look a little odd about it to you?#
TORRES: No, there's something else strange about it. The residue has a point four one percent trace of a neosorium composite, and I don't know anyone who uses neosorium technology except for the Federation. So how did it get into the hands of the Kazon?#
TORRES: One minor subspace disruption and you're dead. It's too risky.#
TORRES: Manipulate it how?#
TORRES: We, er, we should be able to make an attempt by tomorrow.#
TORRES: No, Captain. When I say tomorrow, I mean tomorrow. I don't exaggerate. Tomorrow is the best I can do.#
TORRES: All right. We'll begin on the Kazon bridge. Carey, Nicoletti, Seska.#
TORRES: Okay. Henard, you're with us. Dismissed.#
TORRES: We're finished with the computer simulations. [Ready room] TORRES#
TORRES: They didn't use a thick enough interior shield casing. Once the nucleonic radiation leaked out, a cascade reaction was inevitable.#
TORRES: There's no doubt about it, Captain. The pattern buffer relays are clearly composed of bio-neural fibres. No other Federation ship would have them. Somebody on board Voyager gave them what they needed. I guess they just didn't know what to do with it.#
TORRES: We're picking up two more Kazon warships about six hours away. We're not going to be able to stay her much#
TORRES: And they're going straight to the missing replicator materials.#
TORRES: They're entering data.#
TORRES: They're entering an encrypted security code into the materials requisition file.#
TORRES: Anybody know whose security code that belongs to?#
TORRES: Then it has to be Carey. Carey is trying to point the finger at Seska.#
TORRES: That's strange. Both containers should have been filled.#
TORRES: I'm aborting transport. Okay, let's try that again. Energising.#
TORRES: All right. I'll get a complete phase spectrum analysis on this as soon as possible.#
TORRES: I'd say more like twenty.#
TORRES: Um, six hours. Maybe more.#
TORRES: Can you convince him to give up his free time?#
TORRES: We think it happened when we beamed aboard the samples from the protostar. There was a breach in the annular confinement beam, and photonic energy must have leaked into the transporter system.#
TORRES: Except it's not supposed to convert people.#
TORRES: I can't get a lock.#
TORRES: Captain, I've lost their life signs. They're gone. [Briefing room] TORRES: A defect that dematerialised our people.#
TORRES: Anyone who goes back in there might wind up just like the others.#
TORRES: And we're going to give you complete control over your magnetic containment field. You'll be able to make yourself solid or let matter pass through you at will.#
TORRES: Captain, take a look at this. The readings from the Doctor's tricorder when the energy surge made contact with him.#
TORRES: Yes, but it's the first time we've had clear readings from a moment of contact. I wonder if I could produce these same patterns in the samples we have in Engineering.#
TORRES: I'm on it.#
TORRES: We're getting a reaction.#
TORRES: What's that?#
TORRES: Let's get a containment field around it.#
TORRES: Okay, now I've got a containment field blocking it.#
TORRES: Let's give it another try. Now it's blocked on three sides.#
TORRES: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?#
TORRES: We may be dealing with a life form.#
TORRES: Torres here.#
TORRES: Force field is in place.#
TORRES: And it seems pretty clear that the energy form was trying to get back to it as though it's a shelter of some kind.#
TORRES: But what are they doing over there? How did they get there?#
TORRES: I'm reading a massive particle surge on our holodeck.#
TORRES: It's a medicine wheel, a talisman used by Chakotay's tribe. He once showed me how it works. He said if anything ever happened to him, that I should perform a special healing ritual.#
TORRES: The wheel represents both the universe outside and the universe inside our minds as well. They believe each is a reflection of the other. When a person is sleeping, or on a vision quest, it's said that his soul is walking the wheel. But if he's in a coma or near death, it means that he's gotten lost. These stones are signposts to help point the way back. Not exactly standard medical procedure, I know, but#
TORRES: How do you know about the medicine wheel?#
TORRES: Find your way home, Commander. [Kes's quarters] (Kes is reading a book.)#
TORRES: : Torres here.#
TORRES: : No one right now. I was there this morning, and Lieutenant Paris was in there just a few minutes ago.#
TORRES: : Positive. I just saw him leave about five minutes ago.#
TORRES: Captain?#
TORRES: What?#
TORRES: Captain, I don't know what you're talking about.#
TORRES: Aye, Captain.#
TORRES: We didn't pick up a discharge of any kind on the internal sensors.#
TORRES: But what if we could perform a magneton scan on the entire ship all at once?#
TORRES: A magneton flash scan. We could reconfigure every sensor array on the ship to emit a single burst. It might be enough to illuminate any anomalous energy. Harry, what do you think? (Harry is staring at nothing, so Tuvok draws his phaser and Torres gets out a tricorder.)#
TORRES: I don't see anything unusual, but that doesn't mean anything.#
TORRES: I'm certain of it. From what I can tell, the energy discharge came from the nebula itself.#
TORRES: He must have been under the alien's influence.#
TORRES: The sensor arrays are charging now. Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes.#
TORRES: How did you manage to reintegrate his consciousness?#
TORRES: Tom? Tom, wake up.#
TORRES: Yeah, it's me.#
TORRES: I remember them grabbing us outside the caves and then I, I guess I just blacked out.#
TORRES: The next thing I knew, they were waking me up in some kind of laboratory. I was so groggy I couldn't see. I asked them what they had done to me and then one of them said that they had completely extracted my Klingon DNA.#
TORRES: I feel so weak, sick to my stomach.#
TORRES: So strange.#
TORRES: When I was a child, I did everything I could to hide my forehead. Hats, scarves, you name it.#
TORRES: I grew up on a colony on Kessik Four. My mother and I were the only Klingons there, and that was a time when relations between the Homeworld and the Federation weren't too cordial. Nobody ever said anything, but we were different and I didn't like that feeling. Then my father left when I was five years old. One day he was there and the next he wasn't. I cried myself to sleep every night for months. Of course I never told anybody. And then I finally decided that he'd left because I look like a Klingon. And so I tried to look human.#
TORRES: Maybe if they think I'm too weak they'll leave me behind. I could try to get my hands on that console over there.#
TORRES: Tom, don't. They'll kill you.#
TORRES: Tom, I've been thinking. When they did this thing to me, I think it changed more than just the way I look.#
TORRES: Back there, when they took Durst away, I was terrified.#
TORRES: You don't understand. I've been in worse situations but I've never felt like that before. Never. I mean, my heart was pounding and my hands were shaking. I didn't even try to help you.#
TORRES: No, that's not it. I think that when they extracted my Klingon DNA, they turned me into some kind of a coward.#
TORRES: That's okay, Tom. Maybe if I'm there I can try to make contact with the ship. [Transporter Room]#
TORRES: Which one?#
TORRES: A human female?#
TORRES: Where are you taking me?#
TORRES: No, please. (They drag Torres away, then B'Elanna attacks. The two Vidiians are easily disposed of. B'Elanna bends down to pick up a weapon and looks at Torres. She holds out her hand and helps her up. Then Torres faints, and B'Elanna carries her off over her shoulder.)#
TORRES: What is it?#
TORRES: No, thanks.#
TORRES: How are we supposed to escape this place? There are guards everywhere.#
TORRES: Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm not exactly in fighting form.#
TORRES: Apparently.#
TORRES: I was looking for a way to escape.#
TORRES: That's the way you respond every situation, isn't it? If it doesn't work, hit it. If it's in your way, knock it down. No wonder I got kicked out of the Academy.#
TORRES: Well, I'm not! Your temper has gotten me into trouble more times that I can. Listen to me. Listen to us. This is ridiculous. Do you realise we're each fighting with our self.#
TORRES: I don't know that I can get out of here with you. Brute force isn't going to do it.#
TORRES: There you go again. Out of control. Just leaping into action before you think things through.#
TORRES: No, wait a minute, that's not what I meant. I'm sorry. Please. Just before you rescued me, I logged onto the Vidiian's computer system. I only had a few seconds, but I think I found a way to access the force field that's cloaking this place. With a few minutes more I could have deactivated it.#
TORRES: It may not be as exciting as fighting our way out, but it stands a much better chance of working, if I have your help.#
TORRES: I can't get back to that computer without you. And you'll have to cover for me while I work.#
TORRES: I have to bypass the security code so I can access the force field grid. Then I'll have a better idea of what we're dealing with. That should do it. There! That's what we're up against, and I think we're here.#
TORRES: I'm working on it.#
TORRES: If they didn't know we were here before, they do now. Take it easy. I'll be done in a minute.#
TORRES: Maybe I just don't have time to think about it. (A guard enters. B'Elanna shoots him but he manages to get a shot at her too.) TORRES: Are you hurt?#
TORRES: I think I've just about accessed the forcefield.#
TORRES: Got it! There!#
TORRES: Beam her to Sickbay!#
TORRES: Wait a minute. You're not saying that you're going to change me back?#
TORRES: So she's saving my life again.#
TORRES: I'm not sure. It's been a pretty strange experience. I do know that right now, the way I am, I'm more at peace with myself than I've ever been before. And that's a good feeling.#
TORRES: I'm incomplete. It doesn't feel like me. I guess I've had someone else living inside of me for too long to feel right without her.#
TORRES: I know. I came to admire a lot of things about her. Her strength, her bravery. I guess I just have to accept the fact that I'll spend the rest of my life fighting with her.#
TORRES: Correct me if I'm wrong, Doctor, but we're talking about a cloud sample large enough to contain a few subatomic particles, right?#
TORRES: Don't worry. We do this all the time. Pre-sequencing complete, Captain. I'm ready to begin transport.#
TORRES: Targeting scanners. Locking on. Energise.#
TORRES: Captain, we have the sample aboard. The containment field is holding.#
TORRES: Good luck, Doctor.#
TORRES: In other words you're afraid you won't make it. That you'll fail this training.#
TORRES: Fine. Then make it through.  It's another power failure.#
TORRES: Deck four, section nine C.#
TORRES: It's another malfunction in the bio-neural circuitry. We're putting a repair crew on it now. Torres out. Dalby. Replace the failed gel pack and check out the adjoining circuits. Make sure we don't have some kind of cascade feedback causing this. We can't just keep replacing these things. Ensign, you're in charge till I get back. I'll be in Sickbay if you need me.#
TORRES: It's your new patient. It's one of the bio-neural gel packs.#
TORRES: It's malfunctioning but I can't find anything wrong with it mechanically. I thought that you could look at the biological component.#
TORRES: What?#
TORRES: Can you be more specific?#
TORRES: Doctor.#
TORRES: Is the crew in any danger?#
TORRES: I'll have to take the forward grids off line. We'll lose replicators but I can reroute the primary systems. How long do you need?#
TORRES: Okay, I'll tell the Captain. [Deck 11 corridor]#
TORRES: Have you found any traces of the bacteria?#
TORRES: We stopped at that planet, Napinne, brought on some food stores for Neelix. Some of it looked pretty strange.#
TORRES: Schplict?#
TORRES: Okay, let's go over the environmental systems. Maybe we're dealing with something airborne.#
TORRES: Chell, what are you doing?#
TORRES: But you're using a micro-resonator.#
TORRES: Why don't you use the magneton scanner? You'd be done in five minutes.#
TORRES: But he'll be at it for hours.#
TORRES: Well, good luck.#
TORRES: The cheese is full of volatile bacterial spores. It has to stay isolated in this portable containment field.#
TORRES: The spores must have travelled through that intake and then into the ventilation system.#
TORRES: More gel packs must be down. If this is getting to the environmental systems we may be in more trouble that we thought. Neelix, this wasn't your fault. The important thing is that we found the source. Get the cheese to Sickbay. The Doctor should look at it as soon as possible.#
TORRES: Doctor! What are you doing?#
TORRES: The internal sensors were damaged during the attack. They must not be reading every life sign on the ship.#
TORRES: The Kazon. Two of their Predator class warships took us by surprise, hit us with a volley of plasma torpedoes. It started a core breach and we had to abandon ship. The Captain and I stayed behind to see if we could stop the breach. At the last second we did.#
TORRES: Because they couldn't. The Kazon tractored all of the life pods onto their ships. They went into warp before we could stop them. What's wrong?#
TORRES: You've got to help the Captain. She was hit by a falling support beam. I didn't want to risk moving her so I had to leave her on the bridge.#
TORRES: The transporters are down. So are the turbolifts. I had to crawl through thirty one Jefferies tubes on five decks just to get here.#
TORRES: You don't understand, Doctor. I'm not going, you are. I'm sending you to the bridge.#
TORRES: Not any more. For the past few weeks we've been setting up holographic emitters on critical decks. We were hoping to set up a remote holo-projection system, give you access to other parts of the ship.#
TORRES: We hadn't even tested the system yet. There was no guarantee it was going to work. I guess the Captain didn't want to get your hopes up.#
TORRES: Decks one through five. We also put them in Engineering, the Mess hall and the cargo bay. All the projectors are in place but the problem is we're going to have to interface with the Sickbay imaging system. That's going to take a lot of power and computer memory. I don't know if we have enough reserve power to spare.#
TORRES: Good idea. I can drop life support down to minimum levels on the lower decks. That should give us enough power. All right, I'll need another twenty minutes to get the projectors online.#
TORRES: All right, the remote projectors are charged and ready to go. Imaging interface stable. Are you ready to try this?#
TORRES: That's right.#
TORRES: There are a couple of things you should know. In order to do this I had to recalibrate your containment field, so your holo-matrix will be very sensitive to disruption. Try to stay away from energy discharges. Phaser fire, forcefields, that sort of thing.#
TORRES: Make sure you do, because if your containment field collapses it'll take hours to re-initialise your programme.#
TORRES: I'm going to head down to engineering and try and get some of the critical systems working. You'll hear from me when I get the comm. system back online. Unless, of course, this doesn't work, in which case I'll see you in about five seconds. Good luck, Doctor.#
TORRES: Klingons put them on the front of ground assault vehicles. They emit a high frequency tone that disperses targ herds in their path. I can modify the#
TORRES: Initiating the field. It's working.#
TORRES: With all due respect, Captain, haven't we done enough observing? These creatures have attacked the ship's key systems. For all we know, they were setting us up for an attack.#
TORRES: A plasma blast is a hostile move. Shouldn't we be thinking about responding?#
TORRES: I could try releasing power from the impulse capacitance cells straight into the driver coils.#
TORRES: All right. I've accessed the capacitance cells. I think I can give you enough for a short burst at impulse. We've got one shot, Captain.#
TORRES: We don't have the power for that.#
TORRES: This is an aggressive life form, Captain. He's only going to respond to an aggressive stance from us.#
TORRES: I can give you enough thruster power to sustain a speed of one hundred kph.#
TORRES: Don't tell us! The wish has to be a secret if it's going to come true.#
TORRES: It might simply be a localised malfunction, but I've never heard anything like it. My guess is#
TORRES: It's a problem with the comm. system itself.#
TORRES: This isn't Engineering.#
TORRES: Baxter, what are you doing here?#
TORRES: And I'm trying to get to Engineering.#
TORRES: Well, at least I know I'm not crazy. Unless we both are.#
TORRES: Did he say what kind?#
TORRES: The Captain is on her way to the Bridge. But if she's having the same trouble we are, who knows if she can get there. I'm going to keep trying to get to Engineering.#
TORRES: Harry.#
TORRES: Just answer one question, Starfleet. Where is here?#
TORRES: Where am I?#
TORRES: I have been walking in circles for the past twenty minutes trying to get to Engineering.#
TORRES: But it's not just that we're being led back here. I mean, rooms are in the wrong place. Is it possible that this distortion ring is somehow changing the layout of the ship?#
TORRES: If we can't get back on foot or on the turbolift, maybe we can rig a site to site transport. Beam ourselves to the Bridge.#
TORRES: Or to Engineering, wherever that is.#
TORRES: Finally! Let's get to work. We've got an emergency situation on board ship. I don't have time to go into details. But you're all to remain at your posts until otherwise notified, whether or not your duty shifts are over. Ensign, prepare to configure transporter systems for a site to site transport. I've got to reset the pattern buffer controls. In the meantime, why don't you check the targeting scanners? (Torres opens a door and looks at a crewman in his underwear, evidently in the privacy of his own quarters.) TORRES: Crewman! There's an emergency situation aboard ship. Just stay right where you are. That's an order.#
TORRES: Then we're ready to give it a try. Activate the auxiliary pattern buffers.#
TORRES: Targeting the Bridge coordinates. Scanners locked. Energise. [Holodeck - Sandrine's] (Paris and Torres beam onto the pool table. Chakotay and Tuvok are also there.)#
TORRES: We locked onto the Bridge coordinates, but this is where we ended up. None of you had any luck either?#
TORRES: Kes must be worried sick.#
TORRES: How are we supposed to reverse something we don't understand? No matter where we go, we end up here. Corridors are realigning. Rooms are in the wrong place. What's the pattern?#
TORRES: And if we fed all that information into the central database, the computer might be able to extrapolate a schematic of the ship as it's configured now.#
TORRES: My guess is it's more than just a distortion ring. It looks like some sort of spatial implosion that's slowly crushing us.#
TORRES: Don't you think it's a little late to be speculating on who or what this thing is? The important thing now is that we find out some way of stopping it.#
TORRES: If I can get back to Engineering, I may be able to generate a shock pulse strong enough to do just that. Of course, I'd have to raise the pressure in the warp core to near critical.#
TORRES: Not if I can precisely tune the shock pulse to the distortion frequency of the ring.#
TORRES: If we don't give this a try, we're going to get crushed anyway. Personally, I'd rather go down fighting.#
TORRES: It's much too dangerous to have someone working at the navigational array during a shock pulse.#
TORRES: Let's keep it that way!#
TORRES: When it reaches fifty three, it'll trigger the shock pulse. We should get out of here by the time it hits fifty!#
TORRES: Attempting to compensate.#
TORRES: Let's move!#
TORRES: Well, in spite of Tuvok's dire predictions, we haven't blown the ship to pieces, have we?#
TORRES: Good. Let's get in there and see if we had any luck dispersing this implosion ring.#
TORRES: What?#
TORRES: I don't think it's just behind the door.#
TORRES: Chakotay, it didn't work.#
TORRES: Paris, we have to get to the navigational array and give Tuvok's plan a try.#
TORRES: Why not?#
TORRES: We've tried everything else. Ready? Here we go.#
TORRES: We've got to figure out a way to generate a stable field.#
TORRES: What are you saying? We're out of options?#
TORRES: You said there was another option.#
TORRES: Excuse me?#
TORRES: I can't believe I'm hearing this from you.#
TORRES: So we're just supposed to sit here and let this thing kill us?#
TORRES: What about the Captain? She's dying.#
TORRES: Chakotay, you're in charge here. Don't you agree we've got to keep trying?#
TORRES: Fine. Fine, Chakotay. Have it your way.#
TORRES: Hi.#
TORRES: What are you doing?#
TORRES: Why?#
TORRES: I guess I could use a little spiritual guidance myself right now. Mind if I join you?#
TORRES: No damage to the hull or ship systems.#
TORRES: You're not going to believe this, Captain, but twenty million gigaquads of new information have been input into the ship's computer.#
TORRES: My guess is it came from the distortion ring.#
TORRES: That's not all, Captain. Our entire database has been copied and downloaded into somebody else's system.#
TORRES: Most of the debris we've examined is composed of a polyduranide alloy which isn't used in the construction of Federation spacecraft.#
TORRES: This ship was Kazon. [Kazon trophy room] (Haliz brings other young Kazon with him.)#
TORRES: I've got something#
TORRES: It appears to be coming from subterranean energy sources, several carefully concealed weapons systems, phaser banks, force fields, proton dischargers#
TORRES: I'm already working on a dampening field to cut through the interference, but it'll take several hours at least.#
TORRES: I still haven't been able to get the dampening field working. I can't even give you an estimate.#
TORRES: Then I guess the Captain's going to be greeted by some unexpected visitors.#
TORRES: The anomaly is sending out heavy subspace distortions. I can't get a positive lock on him.#
TORRES: I'll try.#
TORRES: We've got him, Captain.#
TORRES: There's another problem, Captain. We won't be able to transport to the surface because of the EM disturbances in the atmosphere. They'll interfere with our comm. links too.#
TORRES: Our range will still be limited, but the transporter should work as long as we stay in an area with reduced electromagnetic activity.#
TORRES: Take the ship through the window into the atmosphere. The closer you can get us to the surface, the better our chances for a successful beam out.#
TORRES: Aye, Captain. Chakotay, take the helm.#
TORRES: Minor damage to our port nacelle. Rerouting power to lateral thrusters.#
TORRES: No, Captain. We've lost them.#
TORRES: I think we're about ready to make our first attempt, Captain.#
TORRES: Exactly. But if he tries to move into an area where there's no emitter field, he'll dematerialise.#
TORRES: Engineering to Sickbay. Doctor, we're ready here.#
TORRES: Okay. Here goes.#
TORRES: I'd guess the imaging interface wasn't properly stabilised.#
TORRES: No, we're bypassing the holodecks.#
TORRES: No.#
TORRES: Not that I'm aware of.#
TORRES: Captain, there has to be a reason why you've had these delusions and we're going to figure out what it is.#
TORRES: We can run the diagnostic from here in Engineering, but you should activate the programme first.#
TORRES: I think I know why. There's a massive energy field coming from those ships. It's bioelectric, modulating on a delta wave frequency. It has psionic properties, and it's permeating the hull.#
TORRES: Not good. I can't get a response from anybody. It's like they're catatonic.#
TORRES: A few minutes ago, there was a momentary interruption in the psionic field. Were there any indications that the alien somehow came on board?#
TORRES: What do we do?#
TORRES: A week? That might be too late.#
TORRES: No, I have to keep trying to set up the resonance burst.#
TORRES: I can't believe you're saying this. You know we have to stay here and try to help the others.#
TORRES: You aren't Chakotay.#
TORRES: I have to help the others.#
TORRES: Yes.#
TORRES: What happened?#
TORRES: Is that who's responsible for all this?#
TORRES: I don't blame you. I think it had quite an impact on all of us. Do you think it's true? That the alien was reading our minds, creating images from our own experiences?#
TORRES: Oh, it's just, I experienced something I'd rather not admit.#
TORRES: I guess. I'll have to think about that. I have an early watch tomorrow, so I'd better turn in. Good night, Captain.#
TORRES: Thanks. You too.#
TORRES: Not really. The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astaline.#
TORRES: That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don't find it soon.#
TORRES: I'm not sure we can transport down. Every time we try to lock onto a transport site, a storm begins.#
TORRES: We've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an electrical storm forms right above the location. When we change sites, a new storm forms and the old one dissipates.#
TORRES: That's as good a guess as any. I can't explain it. We just can't transport.#
TORRES: Shields are holding.#
TORRES: Visibility still zero. Switching to enhanced terrain scanning.#
TORRES: It's just what we've been looking for. Almost pure polyferranide. But there's a problem with crust reactivity. If we can't solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield.#
TORRES: What?#
TORRES: The dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we've never encountered before, Commander.#
TORRES: Where's Chakotay?#
TORRES: I've got them running twenty percent over rated maximum.#
TORRES: I can try to#
TORRES: Ten minutes. I just need#
TORRES: I'm sorry, Captain. That's all we've got.#
TORRES: I'm scanning the remains on all biospectral frequencies. It's completely inert. Dead.#
TORRES: I'm picking up life signs. They're sporocystian.#
TORRES: But according to my readings, the life signs aren't coming from the remains. The remains are simply resonating in response to an external energy source. Some other lifeform.#
TORRES: The lifesigns are gone.#
TORRES: If that's true, maybe we could use them to track her down.#
TORRES: We've placed the remains in a hexiprismatic field, Captain. The next time it responds to sporocystian energy, the field#
TORRES: The life signs are fading and I still can't get a lock on the coordinates.#
TORRES: We've got it, Captain.#
TORRES: What are you talking about? I was ahead, nineteen seven.#
TORRES: Sure you were.#
TORRES: I do not tense up.#
TORRES: How could someone be transmitting a Federation signal from the Delta quadrant?#
TORRES: They modified the bow to puncture our hull.#
TORRES: We'll have to reroute additional power to the containment field and tow their shuttle out with one of our own. Then we can repair the breach. The shields and the warp drive will have to wait.#
TORRES: How do we do that?#
TORRES: Seska modified an anti-proton beam to penetrate its shields and hull.#
TORRES: But if I remember correctly, the beam was only effective from an extremely close range. How do we get near enough to the Nistrim ship?#
TORRES: You're taking this all very personally, aren't you?#
TORRES: You're not responsible for what happened.#
TORRES: So you have lousy taste in women. Look, Chakotay, she fooled us all. She was my best friend. Or at least, that's what I thought.#
TORRES: Are you sure? Because she's affecting you. That's just where she wants you. Don't tense up.#
TORRES: He was in Engineering helping me modify the coil scanner. He said he'd be right up.#
TORRES: The coil scanner was right here. He must've taken it with him.#
TORRES: Looks like that.#
TORRES: Just that he thought he felt responsible for Seska and was determined to stop her. But I never thought he would try to do this alone.#
TORRES: Do you have a minute, Captain? It's about Chakotay.#
TORRES: Well, I thought that maybe I could explain#
TORRES: I know it was never his intention to defy you. He respects your authority.#
TORRES: But he's a very proud man. And he's been embarrassed by Seska.#
TORRES: He never said it to me directly but, I think he was in love with her. And then he found out that everything he knew about her was a lie. You said that he publicly defied your authority. Can you imagine what it must have been like for someone as private as Chakotay to be publicly humiliated by someone he loved? And then, as if that weren't enough, she came back to taunt him in front of the entire Bridge crew.#
TORRES: That's only part of it. I know Chakotay. This is his way of taking responsibility. In his mind, he's trying to protect the rest of us from a dangerous situation which he created.#
TORRES: I know that. It's just that Chakotay would never tell you any of this himself.#
TORRES: I know that you're well within your rights to throw him into the brig, but, well#
TORRES: Thank you.#
TORRES: We've got to go get him.#
TORRES: We don't have to honour that request. Captain?#
TORRES: I would never want you to ignore your judgment, Captain, but let me ask you this. In your judgment, how would the loss of our First Officer affect this crew? What would it do to the morale on this ship? Maybe this is an instance when your gut is giving you better advice.#
TORRES: We can transport him out.#
TORRES: Not necessarily. We could beam him out at warp speed without even slowing down. The Kazon would never be able to catch us.#
TORRES: I can compensate for that.#
TORRES: By synchronising the transporter's annular confinement beam to the warp core frequency.#
TORRES: Do you have a better idea? Trust me, Captain. I can do it.#
TORRES: Because I've done it before. When you're a Maquis, you don't always have the luxury of following protocols. [Kazon briefing room]#
TORRES: I've got a lock. Initiating transport.#
TORRES: I'm trying, but I need more time.#
TORRES: I'm doing the best I can. [Kazon briefing room]#
TORRES: There's a control circuit there. I can see it.  If only we knew that Neelix made it back to the ship with the tellerium, then at least this would be worth it.#
TORRES: We don't even know what happened to the Captain. She might have been killed out there on the street.#
TORRES: I guess that's the Vulcan way of telling me to hope for the best. [Caylem's home] (A single room. Caylem is singing to himself near the doorway when Janeway wakes. Her neck wound has a green plaster on it.)#
TORRES: We told you already. We don't know anything about the Resistance.#
TORRES: I told you I don't.#
TORRES: I'm sorry. I guess I always assumed that Vulcans didn't feel pain like the rest of us. That you were able to block it out somehow. Until I heard. Was that you I heard?#
TORRES: How can you say that so calmly? You must feel some anger at what they did to you, some desire to fight back.#
TORRES: Captain, what are you doing?#
TORRES: It's extraordinary.#
TORRES: It's losing power. I'd like to move it to Engineering to see if I can repair it before it drains completely.#
TORRES: Captain, this thing has a completely unfamiliar power source. Once it stops working it's very possible I won't be able to get it going again, and we'll have lost an opportunity to study a new technology.#
TORRES: The power's surging. If we can't find a way to stabilise it, we're going to lose it.#
TORRES: Well, the energy signatures are incompatible, but it might buy us some time. Okay, let's give it a try. Two second burst, five percent maximum output. On my mark. Now. We're losing it.#
TORRES: Let's try a longer burst at lower power.#
TORRES: Now. I think it's working. EPS flow is holding steady. EM field leakage is minimal.#
TORRES: Let's try to keep it below eighty five percent.#
TORRES: Let's reinforce the power conduit coupling just to be on the safe side. (The object zooms in on a monitor to reveal that it is a silver robot. After the opening titles, we're back to colour and normal viewpoint.) TORRES: It's suffered a lot of damage, but I think the EPS charge will keep it running for at least eighteen hours.#
TORRES: This looks like some kind of programming centre.#
TORRES: It's got arms, legs, we saw it move it's head. It's clearly designed to perform motor functions. So where did those commands come from?#
TORRES: Speaking of sources, this energy module seems to be what powers the entire mechanism. It isn't designed to run on EPS energy, it runs on some kind of super-conducting plasma. If we keep charging it, we may end up destroying it.#
TORRES: It's trying to communicate.#
TORRES: What are you trying to say? What's Pralor? If you can hear me, try to move, try to move your arm.#
TORRES: We've got to figure out a way to fix it.#
TORRES: You go ahead. I could use some time alone to think.#
TORRES: Get some rest, Harry.#
TORRES: Don't make me laugh, Starfleet. And don't make me pull rank on you either.#
TORRES: Just coffee.#
TORRES: You're cutting me off? Oh, I guess you're right. It was starting to taste almost palatable.#
TORRES: All I've been able to do is postpone the inevitable. The constant power depletion is like a bleeding artery, and I haven't got a tourniquet.#
TORRES: Let me guess. Leola root.#
TORRES: Salt?#
TORRES: That is a very interesting story, Neelix. Now how about some more coffee.#
TORRES: I'm going. I'm going.#
TORRES: Anybody home? What's that? You think I should go to bed too? Well, I guess I'm outnumbered.#
TORRES: This is what I sleep in. I didn't have time to change.#
TORRES: An engineering problem actually, but I thought you might have#
TORRES: Not an engineer, right, but this isn't a typical engineering problem. I've been working on trying to repair a robot.#
TORRES: He's about to die.#
TORRES: Die, stop functioning, whatever, unless I can figure out a way to sustain his main energy source.#
TORRES: It's some sort of chromo-dynamic module powered by a tripolymer plasma, but the plasma is contaminated. It's decaying.#
TORRES: Right. It can't retain enough energy to keep the module running.#
TORRES: You mean replacing the plasma itself? Well, that was one of my first ideas, but where do I get my hands on a polymer plasma composed of elements I didn't even know existed twenty four hours ago?#
TORRES: It's, it's a very different substance. Too highly charged. It would burn out the robot's systems in seconds. It would be like trying to give a Bolian a blood transfusion from a Vulcan.#
TORRES: It's a good idea, but warp plasma radiates at too high a frequency to alter electrochemically. Unless.#
TORRES: I could modify a series of anodyne relays, attach them directly to the robots power module. They could act as a sort of regulator to make the warp plasma compatible with the robot's energy matrix.#
TORRES: Activating the relays. All right, Harry, start the infusion. Twenty percent nominal flow.#
TORRES: Energy levels are up fourteen percent.#
TORRES: Harry, give it a little more juice.#
TORRES: Wait, the energy levels are rising too fast. We're going to burn out it's systems.#
TORRES: Let's give it a try. It's stabilising. Hold the flow right there. Let's see what happens. The plasma is circulating. The programming centre is activated. I think we may have done it.#
TORRES: I'm Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres of the Federation Starship Voyager.#
TORRES: Automated Personnel Unit 3947 is an extremely well designed machine.#
TORRES: So how did you end up floating in space so badly damaged?#
TORRES: Do you know what caused the explosion?#
TORRES: Do you remember where you come from?#
TORRES: Well, we'll do our best to find your ship and return you to your people.#
TORRES: I'm hoping that the memory loss is only temporary. Once the new plasma has the chance to fully integrate into your systems, I think you'll be pretty close to optimal.#
TORRES: Yes, I adapted your module to accept our warp plasma as an energy source.#
TORRES: A builder? Well, I guess you could say that. I'm an engineer. I'm responsible for repairing and maintaining all the systems on the ship.#
TORRES: The Builders are the people who created you?#
TORRES: And they're humanoids like me?#
TORRES: You don't need a new module. The one I just fixed will work fine now.#
TORRES: Can't the Builders make additional units?#
TORRES: Now they're wearing out, breaking down. They've learnt to make repairs to themselves, some pretty complex, but the construction of a power module, the device that sustains them, is beyond their grasp. It's an incredible challenge, Captain, but with enough time to study their systems, I might be able to do it.#
TORRES: They've expressed a desire to procreate. That's basic to any life form.#
TORRES: Are you sure? Suppose they were organic but they had become sterile, and we had a treatment that would enable them to start reproducing again. Would you withhold that treatment?#
TORRES: What's the difference?#
TORRES: To correct a flaw.#
TORRES: I'm trying to save them from extinction.#
TORRES: So you're just willing to let their entire society die off.#
TORRES: Some day could be too late. There are only a few hundred of them left.#
TORRES: Captain!#
TORRES: She's following our Prime Directive.#
TORRES: It forbids us to interfere in the natural development of other cultures.#
TORRES: Captain Janeway doesn't think that's a good idea.#
TORRES: Maybe. I don't know. I'd like to try, but I can't.#
TORRES: So did I. We've located your ship. We should be in communications range in about an hour.#
TORRES: And you'll have to remodulate the anodyne relays periodically.#
TORRES: I'm just making sure. Well, I guess this is goodbye. (Torres holds out her hand. 3947 takes it and then there is a whirring sound.) TORRES: What are you doing? (Energy flows over Torres, and she collapses into 3947's arms. It then zaps the transporter operator.)#
TORRES: What the hell is going on here?#
TORRES: I told you I can't help you. Now return me to my ship.#
TORRES: Torres to Voyager.#
TORRES: I helped you. I reactivated you. Why are you doing this?#
TORRES: Captain Janeway won't let you get away with this.#
TORRES: They're helpless. Can't you see that?#
TORRES: We are not your enemies.#
TORRES: Captain Janeway backed me when I wanted to reactivate you, over the objections of her Chief Security officer. You wouldn't even be here if it weren't for her. All right, if that's what it will take to stop this, I'll do it. I'll build your damned prototype!#
TORRES: Proceed. Right. But the question is, where do I proceed from? Let me ask you this. Have any of you ever tried to build a prototype.#
TORRES: What was the problem?#
TORRES: And you're sure you reproduced the module exactly?#
TORRES: Well, let's see. We've been working for about five minutes so I guess we don't have a lot of progress to report.#
TORRES: Why? We don't seem to be any match for you.#
TORRES: I don't know if a promise means anything to you people but it does to us. I gave you my word that I'd do my best, and I will.#
TORRES: Thank you. But I have to tell you there are no guarantees here. Building a prototype from scratch is a lot different than repairing a broken power module. I don't even know if it's possible.#
TORRES: I don't need to be threatened. I told you I'd do my best.#
TORRES: Let me see one of those terminated power modules. [Briefing room]#
TORRES: The automated units are modular. Your parts are identical, interchangeable, right?#
TORRES: So if you lose an arm you can replace it with another one, and over the years you've learnt to make new arms because they're all the same and your programming is sophisticated enough to allow you to reproduce what you see. But each power module has a slightly different energy signature, so even if you copy this guy's module exactly it wouldn't work in any other unit. As far as I can tell, every automated unit has a power module with a unique energy code.#
TORRES: I don't think so.#
TORRES: Hey, do all you automated units give up the minute you hit a bump in the road?#
TORRES: What we've got to do is design a standardised module with a uniform energy code that can power any unit.#
TORRES: You took the words right out of my mouth.#
TORRES: If this works, will you be in charge of assembling the new units?#
TORRES: Sounds like you just volunteered for new duty. I hope you're watching closely.#
TORRES: Well, once we have the prototype, all you'd have to do is copy it. Tell me something, thirty nine. Can I call you thirty nine?#
TORRES: Fine. 3947. Did you wake up on a bench like this one? How long have you been alive?#
TORRES: Tell me something more about these Builders. Were they anything like us?#
TORRES: Well. I asked about your culture, only fair you should ask about mine.#
TORRES: As a matter of fact, it does.#
TORRES: Well, they come different shapes, and sizes. Some have limbs, some don't. Most don't have your cognitive abilities.#
TORRES: I guess, you could say that the robots we use are servants in a manner of speaking. But they aren't sentient like you. In fact, we have only one sentient artificial life form in our society, and he is treated the same as any human.#
TORRES: That's right. He works on a ship just like you or I. He wears the same uniform I do.#
TORRES: He has a name like the rest of us. Data.#
TORRES: Ah, looks like this standardised power module is working pretty well so far.#
TORRES: Don't send me flowers yet. I've still got to see whether it will power an actual unit.#
TORRES: Well, it fits. Cross your fingers. So far so good. Let's hope it can interface with the unit.#
TORRES: It does not function correctly yet. Your builders should have programmed you with a little more patience. I'm going to try adjusting the flux capacitance.#
TORRES: We did it. We actually did it!#
TORRES: I am congratulating you. You're a father!#
TORRES: Robots from another world?#
TORRES: Why are they attacking you?#
TORRES: The Cravic Builders, the Pralor Builders, were they enemies?#
TORRES: Look, maybe Captain Janeway can contact the Cravic leaders and convince them to stop the fighting, then#
TORRES: Why not?#
TORRES: Has anyone in all these years ever tried to stop this war?#
TORRES: Wait a minute. If both sides called a truce, then why didn't they stop you from fighting?#
TORRES: And?#
TORRES: The individual energy codes. Is that why the builders added them? To prevent the procreation of these units? My god, what have I done?#
TORRES: Yes, I have.#
TORRES: Never.#
TORRES: I never wanted to be your enemy. I'm sorry.#
TORRES: Mmm. I never thought Neelix's coffee could taste so good.#
TORRES: I don't know what to say.#
TORRES: Thank you.#
TORRES: Difficult?#
TORRES: It was necessary.#
TORRES: You should have seen it, Captain. It was incredible. I installed that module, and the prototype looked up at me and asked me for programming.#
TORRES: It was necessary.#
TORRES: Aye, Captain.#
TORRES: Setting up a class three containment field, Captain. Field in place.#
TORRES: Energising. (A stocky male figure in an Engineering uniform appears, and walks through the containment field.)#
TORRES: Torres to Janeway. You'd better get down here, Captain.#
TORRES: Yes, ma'am. That transport from the comet? It brought a man aboard. He says his name is Q.#
TORRES: This ship will not survive the formation of the cosmos.#
TORRES: No!#
TORRES: We've got to get him to Sickbay right away. Torres to Sickbay.#
TORRES: He saved my life once, near the Cardassian border. [Ready room]#
TORRES: Actually that's a good idea.#
TORRES: Not at all. Seska has been trying to forge an alliance among the Kazon. She would jump at the chance to get our support.#
TORRES: Nothing's going on yet. The Captain's talk with Seska fell apart pretty quickly.#
TORRES: No, I couldn't.#
TORRES: Hogan, its gone too far. Seska isn't the person we thought she was. I don't trust her any more.#
TORRES: Who are you to be second guessing Captain Janeway? The hardest thing you have to think worry is keeping that dilithium chamber filled. She os doing the best she can to get us home and if you don't like the way she's doing it, I really don't want to hear about it. Is that clear?#
TORRES: We have a reasonable supply of anti-matter. Barring any major problems, we should have maximum performance of both warp and impulse engines.#
TORRES: You're dead. [Mess hall] TORRES: No, I've thought about that already. It's too brittle.#
TORRES: Do you have anything to eat?#
TORRES: I guess I'll go find them myself. Fill him in.#
TORRES: So we can try a manned test flight?#
TORRES: How's his dilithium matrix holding up?#
TORRES: Okay. Torres to shuttlecraft Cochrane. You're clear for transwarp velocity. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane]#
TORRES: Tom!#
TORRES: You brought it back without a scratch. The on-board sensors confirm that you did it. You made it to warp ten.#
TORRES: Then it's just a matter of navigation. If we could figure out how to come out of transwarp at a specific point, this could get us home.#
TORRES: Right. [Mess hall]#
TORRES: Well, you might as well get used to it. You're a hero now.#
TORRES: Smells okay.#
TORRES: I agree. We have to confirm that none of this was a fluke.#
TORRES: What? What's wrong?#
TORRES: Do you want to go back to Sickbay?#
TORRES: Torres to Transporter room two. Medical emergency. Beam Lieutenant Paris directly to Sickbay.#
TORRES: Torres to Sickbay. We need a medical team in the mess hall right away. Hang on, Tom.#
TORRES: Just a cup of Neelix's coffee.#
TORRES: What is?#
TORRES: He's allergic to water?#
TORRES: What should we do?#
TORRES: What's happening to him?#
TORRES: Antiprotons? The only place on this ship which generates antiprotons is the warp core.#
TORRES: We'll have to take the warp core offline, then I'll need about three hours to set up an interface.#
TORRES: The interface is charged and ready.#
TORRES: Take the warp engines offline. Bleed off point zero five seven AMUs of antiproton radiation. Shunt it through the interface.#
TORRES: Was there any indication yesterday that there was something wrong?#
TORRES: I guess we'll just have to get in there and track it down. [Mess hall]#
TORRES: Sorry I'm late. These are the duty logs from last night. Lon Suder was the only one in Engineering when Frank Darwin came on duty.#
TORRES: As a Maquis, he did what he had to do a little too well.#
TORRES: In the Maquis, we didn't ask for resumes. We needed all the help we could get.#
TORRES: We've identified the signature left by the weapons fire. There's no question. It was Cardassian.#
TORRES: No, Captain. I am. [Briefing room] TORRES: I recognise it's signature because, because I know this weapon very well. Chakotay and I got our hands on it when we were fighting the Cardassians.#
TORRES: The last time we saw it, it was heading in the same direction in the Badlands where the Caretaker picked us up.#
TORRES: Now add to that one of the most sophisticated computer systems I've ever seen. They made this missile adaptable, evasive, armed with it's own defensive weaponry. In other words, unstoppable.#
TORRES: Leave it to the Cardassians to build such an incredibly advanced tactical weapon and then arm the warhead with an old kinetic detonator.#
TORRES: I got inside it and reprogrammed the computer. Hell, I didn't just reprogramme it, I changed it's identity. I made it forget about being Cardassian. Now it was working for the Maquis.#
TORRES: Dreadnaught masks its warp trail with a randomised EM field, but I can modify our navigational sensors to cut through that.#
TORRES: I get back inside it. I know all the security codes. I installed them myself.#
TORRES: Chakotay wasn't telling the whole truth. We didn't send Dreadnought on a mission against the Cardassians. I was the one who sent it, without asking him.#
TORRES: After I did it, he pulled me aside and I was ready to defend myself. I was so sure that I had anticipated everything that could possibly go wrong. I even programmed it to warn Federation ships to stay out of its way, in my own voice.#
TORRES: Listening to that Cardassian computer's voice was driving me crazy.#
TORRES: Anyway, Chakotay looked at me. I didn't know him very well yet. And all he said, in that damned soft voice of his was that I'd hurt him. That he thought he'd earned my trust and loyalty. I was so glad when it disappeared into the Badlands. I remember thinking, thank god, it's over. But it's not. And if anything happens here because of Dreadnought, it's my fault. No one else's.#
TORRES: Tell me about it.#
TORRES: Tom, what's been going on with you lately?#
TORRES: People are starting to talk.#
TORRES: No, I mean people. Like me. Like today. Look at yourself, coming to a briefing late. And is it true you had a fight with Lieutenant Rollins?#
TORRES: Was he right about your reports?#
TORRES: No, this is deliberate. It's following one of the evasive patterns I programmed into it. It must have observed us following.#
TORRES: No, that's only a sensor echo. Dreadnought's programmed to deflect it's up to one hundred thousand kilometres from it's true location. The next time you get a heading look for a brief surge in neutrino emissions within a one hundred thousand kilometre radius. That'll be the real thing.#
TORRES: It's targeting scanners have been activated.#
TORRES: It's heading for a planet in a system over ten light years away. At its current speed, it'll get there in about three weeks.#
TORRES: Dreadnought's shields have responded to my codes. I'm ready now, Captain.#
TORRES: Energise.#
TORRES: Not so well, to tell you the truth. Activate programmer interface.#
TORRES: Something's gone wrong with your programming, Dreadnought. Display targeting schematic.#
TORRES: Maybe there's something wrong with your diagnostic systems too. Identify target.#
TORRES: What targeting parameters are you using?#
TORRES: Enough. Dreadnought, you're no where near Aschelan Five.#
TORRES: Let me check out your navigational systems.#
TORRES: That was my idea, wasn't it.#
TORRES: Okay, We'll have to go at this in a different way then, won't we. Dreadnought, do you know what happened to you the day after my last systems access?#
TORRES: Did you encounter a coherent tetryon beam?#
TORRES: That beam carried you into the Delta quadrant. I'm not surprised it damaged your sensors. Dreadnought, reinitialise your navigational systems. Computer.#
TORRES: Okay. Now verify our current position.#
TORRES: And is Aschelan Five located in the Delta quadrant?#
TORRES: Then reconfirm your target lock.#
TORRES: Go ahead Captain.#
TORRES: Dreadnought, return to stage five. Initiate power save programme.#
TORRES: Sweet dreams. [Ready Room]#
TORRES: Easily converted to Starfleet specs. We'll have spare parts for years.#
TORRES: This isn't possible. When I left it was completely shut down.#
TORRES: Aye, Captain.#
TORRES: Dreadnought, why have you resumed course?#
TORRES: My deception?#
TORRES: Why would I enter false information?#
TORRES: So when I was just over there and you shut yourself off, you were lying to me?#
TORRES: I never taught it to do that.#
TORRES: The one possible vulnerability I remember is in the thoron shock emitter. If we can get it to fire at full power, that should destabilise the reactor core for thirty seconds. A single sustained tachyon beam might just penetrate that core and destroy it.#
TORRES: It shouldn't be that difficult. Once we go after it with an all-out assault, the emitter should fire.#
TORRES: We don't have time for this.#
TORRES: We wouldn't have to if I'd done my job right the first time.#
TORRES: Why not? Dreadnought seems pretty good at guessing mine.#
TORRES: I'm not so sure about that, Harry. It's programmes are adaptive and it's been accumulating data all this time. It spends every minute of every day thinking about new strategies, new probabilities.#
TORRES: All right, Starfleet, let's give it another try.#
TORRES: Oh, yeah. Swell day.#
TORRES: I'm disappointed in you, Dreadnought. If I really was a Cardassian agent, you should have killed me with the first charge.#
TORRES: Somehow I expected you to put up more of a fight. Computer?#
TORRES: Tell me what's happening.#
TORRES: The Rakosan fleet.#
TORRES: Those ships aren't your enemy. They are not Cardassian. Can't you recognise that?#
TORRES: Dreadnought's created back-up systems to replace the ones I tried to disable.#
TORRES: I'm reluctant to discuss them in present company, but could you send over a. Captain?#
TORRES: What took you so long?#
TORRES: So, it's just you and me now.#
TORRES: Now, that wouldn't make much sense, would it? I'd be killing myself in the process.#
TORRES: If I'm being coerced by Cardassians, why would I be willing to sacrifice myself for them? Answer that one.#
TORRES: Ah, ha. Gotcha. Why don't we reassess those probabilities together, okay? Remember how we used to play hypothetical games?#
TORRES: Let's play one now. Here's a hypothetical situation for you. Suppose I've been telling you the truth all along, and you really are in the Delta quadrant.#
TORRES: Hypothetical, Dreadnought. It's a game, remember? Assume it's true for a moment.#
TORRES: And we're heading for the wrong target.#
TORRES: Millions of innocent people about to die when you detonate.#
TORRES: Now, explain to me how this might happen.#
TORRES: Just for the fun of it, let's have a look at those databanks. See if anything looks at all compromised.#
TORRES: Is this a complete file directory? There seem to be a few missing.#
TORRES: Oh, I'm hurt you don't trust me. Hold on, pause the display. What's that? Computer, identify the Cardassian file on screen.#
TORRES: Looks like a back-up file. Computer, when was this file created?#
TORRES: I believe that was before you and I ever met.#
TORRES: A new conclusion?#
TORRES: Dreadnought.#
TORRES: I'm not interested in your key systems anymore, Dreadnought.#
TORRES: Seriously. Check for yourself.#
TORRES: Oh, just killing time.#
TORRES: I never thought I'd be glad to hear that voice again.#
TORRES: Check those diagnostics, Dreadnought. You're talking to yourself. I believe you're having an identity crisis.#
TORRES: Computer, identify the target.#
TORRES: Yes.#
TORRES: I may be able to detonate the warhead from here#
TORRES: Good for you.#
TORRES: Estimated time to breach.#
TORRES: Unless I'm mistaken, you're out of options, Dreadnought.#
TORRES: I'm not going anywhere until I'm finished.#
TORRES: No deal.#
TORRES: Yes.#
TORRES: Nice try. Who would have thought two years ago, after all those weeks we spent together perfecting your programme, that we'd end up out here trying to kill each other.#
TORRES: Yes, Captain. There's a slight imbalance in the magnetic constrictors. It's causing the plasma stream to overheat. I have a team working on it.#
TORRES: Go ahead.#
TORRES: What is it?#
TORRES: I'm on my way.#
TORRES: Just stay out of our way.#
TORRES: Have you tried adjusting the power transfer conduits?#
TORRES: We have to try to contain the reaction in the core. Don't let the PTC temperature get above three point two million Kelvins.#
TORRES: If you vent some plasma that hot through the nacelles, the warp coils are going to fry.#
TORRES: Reinforce the structural field around the power transfer conduits, and then prepare to begin venting plasma!#
TORRES: It's cascading. Get away from that console!#
TORRES: Get away, Jonas!#
TORRES: Computer, initiate plasma venting!#
TORRES: PTC temperature is dropping. Approaching safe levels. We're under control.#
TORRES: Which means the warp engines are useless until we can rebuild them.#
TORRES: That's right. It's composed of polysilicate verterium and monocrystal cortenum.#
TORRES: I have been since the accident.#
TORRES: What brings you here?#
TORRES: Why would you be interested in the comm. logs?#
TORRES: Well, I can get you into them, but then you're on your own. I'm still trying to bring the magnetic constrictors into alignment.#
TORRES: How far back do you want to go?#
TORRES: Okay. The file's open. Transmissions are logged on by date and time. Anything else?#
TORRES: Mike, we're going into the computer core to look over the magnetic constrictor circuitry. Hold down the fort. All right?#
TORRES: I'm a little busy right now, Neelix. What do you need?#
TORRES: Mister Hogan, could you please help Neelix out for a minute?#
TORRES: It doesn't sound simple to me. I still have nightmares about what those people did to me. And now, you want to crack open my head, cut out a piece of my brain and give it to her?#
TORRES: Not to me, it isn't.#
TORRES: I am not going to#
TORRES: That is an understatement.#
TORRES: Of course I, I'd like to help you if I can.#
TORRES: I'll go and get changed.#
TORRES: Our antimatter supply is being drained, Captain. I don't know why. The containment fields are in place. It's like we sprung a leak, but I can't find the crack.#
TORRES: Hogan! These proton bursts are going to cause a lot of stress on the hull. Reinforce structural integrity to, now what?#
TORRES: That's why we need to reinforce the field. We'll use the power conduits on this deck.#
TORRES: Make it fast, Harry. Torres to Hogan. What's your status?#
TORRES: Harry, grab my hand!#
TORRES: Harry!#
TORRES: Kes, over here.#
TORRES: Torres to Bridge. Ensign Kim is dead.#
TORRES: You don't have to tell me twice.#
TORRES: I don't know. It's some kind of com. emission coming through all subspace bands.#
TORRES: Good question. I can't tell, but it's got a Federation signature.#
TORRES: I think someone's telling us to lock onto a frequency of twelve gigahertz.#
TORRES: I'll try to clear it up.#
TORRES: And her explanation of how the ship were duplicated, certainly plausible.#
TORRES: Both ships would have to send out a massive resonance pulse from their deflector dishes at exactly the same time.#
TORRES: Deflector dish charging. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES#
TORRES: The pulses have been emitted, Captain. The fields are starting to depolarise. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] (Both ships are shaking.)#
TORRES: I can't! Too much plasma back flow. If we keep this up, we're going to lose our antimatter connection. We'll both be destroyed!#
TORRES: I've lost the comm. link again.#
TORRES: Ah, it's about time.#
TORRES: We found a vein of pure polyferranide, three kilometres long. It's a real shame we're leaving.#
TORRES: When we spoke to them, they were going to check out the outermost moons.#
TORRES: That's where Neelix and I went.#
TORRES: Our scans of the moon are inconclusive. We can't see anything through the turbulence in the atmosphere.#
TORRES: The targeting scanners still can't lock onto anything on the surface. It would be easier if we sent down another shuttle.#
TORRES: I'll keep working on it. [Drayan moon] (Night has fallen. Tuvok has lit a fire and is continuing with repairs when Corin comes up to him.)#
TORRES: Actually we've found two, both crashed on the surface. The sensor resolution is still quite low. This looks like our shuttle. I'd guess the other one is Drayan.#
TORRES: I've been working on the transporters. It just isn't possible to get a pattern lock through all the turbulence.#
TORRES: Then why don't they get themselves out?#
TORRES: Understood.#
TORRES: Normal. (Garishly painted walls. Lots of acrobats writhing around to slightly merry electronic music.)#
TORRES: Neither do I.#
TORRES: Another town.#
TORRES: We want to talk to them.#
TORRES: Let's get out of here.#
TORRES: Harry! Harry! (Kim has his hands fastened behind his back, is carried to the guillotine and put in it face down. All the characters think this is hilarious.) TORRES: Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry!#
TORRES: What is going on? Who is he?#
TORRES: That's our wake-up call. It's been a real pleasure, but we're leaving. Come on.#
TORRES: How is that possible?#
TORRES: But none of this is real.#
TORRES: Then you'd better let us tell them.#
TORRES: Who wished him up?#
TORRES: Not unless you're prepared to leave one person in stasis permanently.#
TORRES: Oh, he'd notice. He was very smart to reject the whole notion of a simulated brain. It just wouldn't be the same. There is no way an artificial intelligence can replace actual brain functions.#
TORRES: I don't know what he could have been talking about. The optronic pathways have nothing to do with the neural interface. It doesn't make any sense.#
TORRES: They, they control the basic elements of the environment, access databanks that were programmed when the system was created. If we interrupt the optronic pathways, we could disassemble that entire world and its characters, piece by piece.#
TORRES: How did Viorsa manage to communicate this without the Clown knowing about it?#
TORRES: I'm not sure how many there are, Captain. And I'll have to do it manually because we don't know how to deprogram the system.#
TORRES: Some kind of protection device. I'm locked out. I'll have to disable it. [Fantasy land] (Viorsa is fighting against being put into the guillotine. The EMH tries to help and is pushed away by a character which then vanishes.)#
TORRES: Just ten more pathways.#
TORRES: We're finished here, Captain.#
TORRES: The recall subroutine has been activated.#
TORRES: Initiating all backup systems. The hostages should regain consciousness in less than ten minutes. [Fantasy land]#
TORRES: Captain, there's a minor glitch in the molecular imaging scanners. Ensign Kim should have it up and running in a few minutes. [Transporter room]#
TORRES: I never thought that botanical science class would come in so handy.#
TORRES: Torres to Transporter room one. [Transporter room] TORRES#
TORRES: I can't believe we haven't been able to find a cure for an insect bite.#
TORRES: You talk as though it were a camping trip. They have to spend the rest of their lives down there.#
TORRES: We've all been distracted, Ensign. That's no excuse.#
TORRES: I can't get anything done here. Nobody can concentrate.#
TORRES: I'm not feeling so terrific myself, but I don't let that get in the way of my work.#
TORRES: How do you think they're taking it? This isn't a Starfleet issue, Harry. It's affecting everyone.#
TORRES: Do what?#
TORRES: Well, that's all well and good, but frankly, I can't think of anything else we can do. If you have any ideas, I'll listen. Otherwise, I think we should take a deep breath and move on. [Planet surface] (Janeway has let her hair down and changed into a dress. She checks her bug traps. Chakotay returns from the woods in leather jerkin, shirt and jeans.)#
TORRES: Sure did.#
TORRES: I'm listening.#
TORRES: We're ready to eject the antimatter container.#
TORRES: Echo displacement.#
TORRES: With all due respect, Doctor, we can't even figure out how to project you into this room. How are we supposed to create holographic ships in space?#
TORRES: You've already done it twice.#
TORRES: The defence systems are going to need all the auxiliary power we have, Doctor.#
TORRES: Doctor!#
TORRES: Captain. (Cavemen appear from behind some rocks. They turn back to watch Voyager take off. The EMH reappears in Sickbay. Suder is hiding in a ventilation duct.) To Be Continued..... (Later, the crew are walking up into towards a range of hills, with an active volcano on the horizon behind them. Some are carrying pointed sticks. Ensign Wildman is carrying her baby, and staggers briefly. Commander Chakotay walks back to her.)#
TORRES: We found a nest about two kilometres away.#
TORRES: How do we get them away from the tunnels?#
TORRES: I was on the decathlon team before I quit the Academy. The track and field coach was furious with me.#
TORRES: Hey! Up here!#
TORRES: Up here. You want us? You want us? Come and get us! Come on. Come and get us. (The natives give chase. Janeway, Kim and two crewman run down to the brush fire to clear the entrance.)#
TORRES: What happened?#
TORRES: Torres to Voyager. We have a medical emergency. Beam Kes and Neelix directly to sickbay.#
TORRES: We aren't going anywhere until we find out what happened to her. What kind of energy was she exposed to?#
TORRES: One of our crew has been critically injured. We aren't going to stand by and do nothing.#
TORRES: If you prevent us from helping Kes, we will hold you directly responsible for anything that happens to her.#
TORRES: The problem is that on this end, it's jumping from point to point so quickly that even at maximum warp, by the time we got to its next probable location, it would be gone.#
TORRES: If we could somehow amplify and polarise that instability, we might be able to get the wormhole to reappear.#
TORRES: We've been bombarding the area of the subspace instability with verteron particles.#
TORRES: And even if we're lucky enough to get it here, it won't be around for long. We'll have a very short window of opportunity to get through.#
