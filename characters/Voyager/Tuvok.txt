TUVOK:  Shields at sixty percent.#
TUVOK: Shields at fifty percent.#
TUVOK: Considering the circumstances, I question that proposal at this time.#
TUVOK: Phasers offline.#
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Firing photons.#
TUVOK: One. Co-ordinates one seven one, mark four three.#
TUVOK: Plasma storm density increasing by fourteen percent. Twenty. Twenty five.#
TUVOK: The Cardassian ship is not reducing power. They're following us in.#
TUVOK: They've taken a hit on their port blade. They're sending out a distress signal on all Cardassian frequencies.#
TUVOK: The storm's activity is typically widespread in this vicinity. I can plot a course, but I'm afraid it will require an indirect route.#
TUVOK: Curious. We've just passed through some kind of coherent tetryon beam.#
TUVOK: Unknown. Now there appears to be a massive displacement wave moving toward us.#
TUVOK: It's not a plasma phenomenon. At current speeds, it will intercept us in less than thirty seconds.#
TUVOK: Still exceeding our speed.#
TUVOK: Wave is continuing to accelerate. It will intercept us in eight seconds. Five.#
TUVOK: I must inform you that I was assigned to infiltrate your crew, sir. I am Captain Janeway's Chief of Security.#
TUVOK: My mission was to accumulate information on Maquis activities, and then deliver you into their waiting hands. That is correct.#
TUVOK: Based on my initial reconnaissance, Captain, I am convinced we are dealing with a single entity in the array. I would suggest he scanned our computers in order to select a comfortable holographic environment. In effect, a waiting room to pacify us prior to biometric assessment.#
TUVOK: It is the most logical explanation. Why else would he have released us unharmed?#
TUVOK: There are no humanoid lifeforms indicated, Captain. Kim and Torres are not within tricorder range. They may not be on the array.#
TUVOK: Captain, I've observed something peculiar about the pulses. They're getting faster.#
TUVOK: The interval between each pulse has decreased by point four seven seconds since we arrived. I can offer no explanation.#
TUVOK: That would mean the planet is incapable of producing rain.#
TUVOK: Captain, you require sleep.#
TUVOK: I did not have the opportunity to meet Mister Kim.#
TUVOK: The crew will not benefit from the leadership of an exhausted captain.#
TUVOK: I am gratified that you came after me so I can offer it once again.#
TUVOK: Are they well?#
TUVOK: That would not be an accurate perception, Captain. Vulcans do not worry.#
TUVOK: As I do them.#
TUVOK: The Federation is made up of many cultures. I am Vulcan.#
TUVOK: I assure you that everything in this room has a specific function. However, it would take several hours to explain it all. I suggest we proceed to your quarters. Perhaps you would care for a bath.#
TUVOK: Sir.#
TUVOK: I'd never have guessed.#
TUVOK: I am pleased you are enjoying yourself, but we are in orbit of the fifth planet. We need your assistance.#
TUVOK: Do you believe our people might be at this location?#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: No, it most certainly will not.#
TUVOK: If you had told us what you had planned, we might have anticipated your irrational behaviour.#
TUVOK: Captain, our sensors did not pick up any indication of an underground civilisation. The subterranean barrier Jabin described may be responsible. It might also block our transporter.#
TUVOK: Captain, the pulses from the array continue to accelerate. The intervals between them have decreased another point eight seconds.#
TUVOK: He would seal them if he no longer intended to use them, to protect the Ocampa from their enemies. Captain, there is now enough evidence to form a reasonable hypothesis. I believe that the Caretaker is dying.#
TUVOK: First, he increases the energy supply to provide the city with a surplus to last at least five years. Then he seals the conduits. The logical conclusion is that he does not intend to continue his role as Caretaker.#
TUVOK: Doubtful. Not after a millennium of providing for these people. I believe that the Caretaker owes something to the Ocampa. I believe the debt that can never repaid is very likely a debt to them. In addition, there were his frequent references to running out of time. I think he knew his death was imminent.#
TUVOK: Powering up phase banks and photon systems.#
TUVOK: The lead Kazon ship is hailing us, Captain.#
TUVOK: They're powering up their weapons.#
TUVOK: Shields are holding.#
TUVOK: The data processing system is behind this wall, Captain.#
TUVOK: The Caretaker?#
TUVOK: Shall I activate the programme to get us back?#
TUVOK: Captain, any action we take to protect the Ocampa would affect the balance of power in this system. The Prime Directive would seem to apply.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: The tricobalt devices are ready.#
TUVOK: They are withdrawing, Captain. [Ready room] (A picture of Janeway, Mark and Molly on her desk monitor. Doorbell.)#
TUVOK: If you will explain what happened, Lieutenant.#
TUVOK: I would like her moved to the brig until formal charges can be filed.#
TUVOK: The Captain has the authority to try Miss Torres here on the ship, considering the extenuating circumstances.#
TUVOK: She struck a fellow officer. That is a court martial offence.#
TUVOK: Miss Torres is no longer a member of the Maquis, and with all due respect, Commander, neither are you. Allowing Miss Torres to get away with a clear violation of regulations sets a bad example for the rest of the crew. It makes it appear as though you were showing favouritism toward the Maquis.#
TUVOK: I will yield my authority in this case to you. However, I will make a full report in my security log.#
TUVOK: That would be inconvenient, but acceptable.#
TUVOK: It is an Emergency Medical Hologram and its abilities are limited. It can only operate within the confines of Sickbay.#
TUVOK: The distortions are emanating from a highly localized disturbance in the space-time continuum. Distance, twenty thousand kilometres off the port bow.#
TUVOK: Captain, I am receiving an audio transmission from within the singularity.#
TUVOK: No response to our hail, Captain.#
TUVOK: Engaging tractor beam. It's working. Beam is penetrating the event horizon.#
TUVOK: Tractor beam disengaged.#
TUVOK: It is another type four quantum singularity. Physical and temporal dimensions are identical to the one we encountered earlier.#
TUVOK: That would imply there was something wrong with the warp drive and the navigational logs.#
TUVOK: What about the navigational array?#
TUVOK: There was an altercation, but it has been resolved.#
TUVOK: I will never cease to be amazed by the human capacity for hyperbole. The situation may be characterised as tense, but one could hardly say that they're about to become violent.#
TUVOK: Are you all right?#
TUVOK: I'd better get you to Sickbay.#
TUVOK: Ship-wide diagnostics have revealed nothing out of the ordinary.#
TUVOK: I've been hailing the ship on all frequencies. No response.#
TUVOK: Deflectors off-line.#
TUVOK: The spatial distortions are increasing.#
TUVOK: The shuttle is returning, Commander. It appears as though they've been damaged. Their comm. system's down. I am unable to raise them.#
TUVOK: Shields are down.#
TUVOK: Hull integrity failing.#
TUVOK: We've cleared the event horizon, Captain. We've returned to normal space.#
TUVOK: We're at the leading edge of a shockwave.#
TUVOK: It consists of differentially charged polaric ions, Captain.#
TUVOK: No satellite system in orbit, no evidence of space craft.#
TUVOK: Radiation is within acceptable levels. Atmosphere, breathable.#
TUVOK: It recalls the Chaltok Four incident.#
TUVOK: A Romulan research colony was nearly destroyed during the testing of one these devices. It lead to the Polaric Test Ban Treaty of 2268.#
TUVOK: Hear what, Lieutenant?#
TUVOK: The chain reaction has shattered subspace, Captain.#
TUVOK: Why haven't they been able to return as Mister Paris did the first time?#
TUVOK: If I know Captain Janeway, she would activate a subspace beacon to assist us.#
TUVOK: How do you suggest we do that?#
TUVOK: The logical place to begin would be at the same location they disappeared.#
TUVOK: The scanners are not showing any subspace fractures in the area now.#
TUVOK: I'm still not showing any lifesigns.#
TUVOK: It only means their comm. badges were caught in the explosion. Further speculation serves no purpose. I suggest we search for other tangible evidence.#
TUVOK: Please elaborate. How can you feel their presence?#
TUVOK: Affirmative.#
TUVOK: May I ask what you expect to accomplish by doing that?#
TUVOK: Unlikely. It would be a highly questionable decision in light of the Prime Directive.#
TUVOK: The issue is whether Captain Janeway would go there, not you, Commander.#
TUVOK: Affirmative. They remain quite numerous in this area.#
TUVOK: It is highly unlikely that Captain Janeway would come here to#
TUVOK: I feel it is my duty to point out there is absolutely no logical reason to believe Kes is correct. However, since I have no alternative course of action to recommend at this time, I suggest we proceed.#
TUVOK: Negative, Captain.#
TUVOK: Sensors do show humanoid life. There is no satellite system and no indications of space craft in the vicinity. It appears to be a pre-warp civilisation.#
TUVOK: There are no natural geological phenomena that could be creating this heat source.#
TUVOK: There was a highly sophisticated forcefield in place.#
TUVOK: This room is the source of the dilithium signature we detected earlier. The power systems here are running on an unusual dilithium matrix.#
TUVOK: It would appear not.#
TUVOK: I would say you are correct, Captain. This appears to be a biological repository.#
TUVOK: Negative. There is however a Kazon liver, and although I cannot identify the other organs on display here I would say they bear a striking similarity to pulmonary organs, epidermal tissue, ocular nerve fibre#
TUVOK: They have erected a forcefield with a rotating phase modulation. We will not be able to disrupt it.#
TUVOK: From what we can tell, it uses a neural resonator to stun the victim, while a quantum imaging begins a microcellular analysis of the entire body.#
TUVOK: Negative.#
TUVOK: Captain, may I suggest you consider carefully what you are about to do.#
TUVOK: I could describe to you in detail the psychological observations I have made about you over the past four years which lead me to conclude you are about to take this ship inside the asteroid. But suffice it to say, I know you quite well.#
TUVOK: We are still following the ion trail, but electro-magnetic interference is limiting our sensor range. I am only able to scan five hundred metres ahead of us.#
TUVOK: Sensors detect a large chamber ahead.#
TUVOK: No, Captain. The walls are emanating severe electro-magnetic interference. I cannot scan them directly.#
TUVOK: The walls of this chamber reflect directed energy. The phaser beam would ricochet along an unpredictable path, possibly impacting our ship in the process.#
TUVOK: The phaser would continue to reflect off the bulkheads until it encountered a non-reflective material.#
TUVOK: Adjusting phaser azimuth to fifteen degrees.#
TUVOK: They are powering engines.#
TUVOK: Security, meet me in transporter room three.#
TUVOK: Proceed, carefully. (Dereth scans Tuvok, then Kes, Janeway, a security guard, then the EMH.)#
TUVOK: There are unusually high levels of omicron particles within this nebula, Captain.#
TUVOK: Precisely.#
TUVOK: A significant concentration appears to exist approximately sixty four million kilometres inside the perimeter.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: Tuvok to Kim. Mister Kim, that is a comment we'd prefer not to hear from a senior officer on the Bridge. It makes the junior officers nervous.#
TUVOK: The level of resistance poses no danger to the hull at this time, Captain.#
TUVOK: Twelve thousand four hundred kilometres.#
TUVOK: Just over seven thousand kilometres.#
TUVOK: I am unable to offer identification, Captain.#
TUVOK: They appear to be made up of a non-reactive material that our sensors do not recognise, Captain.#
TUVOK: Uncertain. There is no indication of directed fire.#
TUVOK: Sensors show a build-up of magnesite dust along the outer rim of the barrier.#
TUVOK: Firing phasers. The barrier is undamaged, Captain.#
TUVOK: Torpedo is loaded.#
TUVOK: Coordinates set.#
TUVOK: Fifty thousand kilometres to the perimeter.#
TUVOK: Thirty five kilometres to perimeter.#
TUVOK: Fifteen thousand kilometres. We've cleared the central mass.#
TUVOK: I'm afraid the concentration of particles is far lower than I originally observed. Furthermore, it appears that many of the particles have now moved outside the energy barrier.#
TUVOK: That would be a logical conclusion.#
TUVOK: Shields are up. Adaptive harmonics are operational.#
TUVOK: EM hull pressure is approaching dangerous levels, Captain.#
TUVOK: Hull pressure is decreasing also.#
TUVOK: Fourteen thousand kilometres to the breach.#
TUVOK: Shields at eighty seven percent.#
TUVOK: The polarity of each charge is rotating so quickly, the shields can not compensate. Engineering]#
TUVOK: Fourteen injuries reported, Captain. None serious.#
TUVOK: May I ask when you became morale officer?#
TUVOK: Shields at seventy five percent and holding.#
TUVOK: Captain, the shields are only designed to withstand#
TUVOK: Regenerative matter approaching. Range, thirty kilometres, fore and aft.#
TUVOK: Regenerative matter at twenty kilometres. Fifteen. Ten.#
TUVOK: There is, of course, a seventy five percent chance the wormhole will not lead to the Alpha Quadrant.#
TUVOK: However, it might be large enough to act as a conduit for a message.#
TUVOK: I recommend we launch a microprobe into the wormhole.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: The probe's telemetry has changed.#
TUVOK: We cannot preclude the possibility that there is a microscopic entity within the wormhole curious about an intruder.#
TUVOK: I fear Mister Kim's exuberance may turn into an equally intense disappointment if his efforts prove in vain.#
TUVOK: Negative Captain. There is nothing that would suggest a response.#
TUVOK: Captain.#
TUVOK: I'm getting something, Captain.#
TUVOK: That signal is being transmitted at exactly the same frequency and amplitude as our signal. It's a response. Someone received our transmission and sent one back, and their signal originated in the Alpha Quadrant. Captain's log, supplemental. Encouraged by his success in transmitting a signal to the Alpha Quadrant, Mister Kim is investigating the possibility of establishing a voice link with whoever is at the other end of the wormhole. [Ready room]#
TUVOK: Perhaps I can offer an explanation. The comm. link signature of his transmission indicates the message originated from a Romulan ship. Further, there are no known shipping lanes in the sector he identified. Given the precise calibration of his signal I would suggest that he is in fact on board a science vessel.#
TUVOK: Precisely. When we claimed to be transmitting from the Delta quadrant, an impossibility so far as he knows, he may have feared we were Federation spies.#
TUVOK: It is a standard Starfleet mechanism with a varietal molecular matrix. It simulates most organic and non-organic compounds. It is not classified technology.#
TUVOK: Then what would you suggest?#
TUVOK: Captain, I must insist that I stay with him at all times while he is on board. [Transporter Room]#
TUVOK: I suggest we delay that for the moment, Captain. I'm afraid I've found the reason for the unusual phase variance.#
TUVOK: Captain, what year is it?#
TUVOK: If you please.#
TUVOK: Exactly. Our Romulan visitor is a person out of time. He is showing clear evidence of temporal displacement. I would surmise that the wormhole is a rift not just in space but in time. The unusual phase variance we detected was actually an indication of a temporal shift. We have transported him from twenty years in the past to our present. [Briefing Room]#
TUVOK: These are our messages.#
TUVOK: Captain, I did not want to mention this until after our guest had left. I checked the computers databanks for a Romulan scientist named Telek R'Mor.#
TUVOK: I'm sorry to report Doctor R'Mor died in 2367.#
TUVOK: That is correct. Before he would have sent our messages.#
TUVOK: It is possible. Unfortunately, there is no way to know.#
TUVOK: Sensors indicate damage to various subsystems.#
TUVOK: That is confirmed, Captain.#
TUVOK: Did you talk to Lieutenant Paris after he was detained?#
TUVOK: They're responding.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: How is this achieved?#
TUVOK: May we speak to him alone?#
TUVOK: Lieutenant, did you murder Professor Ren?#
TUVOK: Were you having improper relations with his wife?#
TUVOK: That does not answer my question.#
TUVOK: Apparently, he's entering another cycle. (Paris seems himself stab Tolen, and collapses. Janeway fetches Kray and the doctor.)#
TUVOK: Away team to Voyager. Three to beam up.#
TUVOK: I would appreciate receiving a copy of your neurological analysis, Doctor.#
TUVOK: Nevertheless, I will want to examine it in detail.#
TUVOK: Perhaps. However, before the neural implants were developed, the Banean punishment for murder was lethal injection. It is possible they would view that as the only alternative sentence in this case.#
TUVOK: When he wakes up, I will require an autonomic response analysis while I question him again, Doctor.#
TUVOK: As an investigator, I do not have the freedom to ignore any possibility. Mister Paris maintains his innocence, yet the victim has identified him from the grave, and the victim's wife has testified against him at the trial. Someone is obviously lying. An ARA will tell us if it is Mister Paris.#
TUVOK: In the meantime, Captain, I request permission to return to the surface.#
TUVOK: I would like to examine the murder scene and speak with Mrs Ren. [The Ren's home] (Lidell opens the front door, carrying Neeka, who growls.) TUVOK: Mrs Ren?#
TUVOK: I'm Lieutenant Tuvok of the Starship Voyager. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?#
TUVOK: I am the Starfleet Chief of Security investigating his alleged participation in your husband's murder.#
TUVOK: Based on your testimony, I assume this is where the murder occurred.#
TUVOK: You chose to remain in the house after an act of such violence occurred?#
TUVOK: I am a Vulcan, Mrs Ren. By nature, we are a dispassionate people. It is rare to encounter someone as dispassionate as we are.#
TUVOK: Thank you, no.#
TUVOK: Please. You testified at the trial that you and your husband had an argument the afternoon before he was killed.#
TUVOK: No.#
TUVOK: My wife and I have been married for sixty seven years.#
TUVOK: May I ask why you decided at this time to end your marriage to Professor Ren?#
TUVOK: That other man was Lieutenant Paris. Lieutenant Paris would have been departing this planet in a few days, and yet you left your husband of ten years for him.#
TUVOK: Exactly when did you see Mister Paris on the day of the murder?#
TUVOK: How did you know?#
TUVOK: Did you leave the room at any time during the fight between your husband and Lieutenant Paris?#
TUVOK: This is Lieutenant Tuvok.#
TUVOK: Thank you. I'll be returning shortly. Tuvok out. Thank you for your help, Mrs Ren.#
TUVOK: The last thing you remember is?#
TUVOK: Was there any evidence of a sedative in his system when he returned here?#
TUVOK: On my way, Commander.#
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Numiri ships are closing. Four thousand kilometres.#
TUVOK: Two thousand kilometres.#
TUVOK: One thousand five hundred kilometres.#
TUVOK: Both Numiri vessels are disabled, Captain.#
TUVOK: Based on the ARA, I am convinced Lieutenant Paris believes what he is saying. However, I can offer no tangible evidence on his behalf. Considering the urgency of the situation, I believe the only logical alternative at this time is to witness the crime myself.#
TUVOK: I propose a mind meld with Lieutenant Paris.#
TUVOK: I've examined your neurological reports, Doctor, and I believe the risk is acceptable.#
TUVOK: Captain, the answers I seek can only be found in the eyes of the murdered man. It may be our only chance to prove Lieutenant Paris innocent.#
TUVOK: Captain, I must consult with Ensign Kim immediately.#
TUVOK: I assume he has access to Professor Ren's research. I believe it will explain not only why Lieutenant Paris has been accused of a murder he did not commit, but also why the Numiri chose to attack us. [Ready room]#
TUVOK: Range, one hundred thousand kilometres and closing. They're changing course, Captain.#
TUVOK: If I am incorrect, we will know it shortly.#
TUVOK: With your permission, I would like to invite all interested parties to meet at the scene of the murder in two hours.#
TUVOK: It is true, Paris's image was seen in the memories examined during the trial. However, that is because someone altered the engrams from Professor Ren's brain.#
TUVOK: I would suggest, sir, that there is no such thing as a technology that is entirely safe from tampering.#
TUVOK: On the contrary. I have not forgotten your statement, Mrs Ren. However, I now know it is clearly false.#
TUVOK: Mister Paris, would you please stand next to Mrs Ren?#
TUVOK: If you wouldn't mind. The man Professor Ren observed with his wife was virtually equal in height to her. Clearly, Lieutenant Paris is several centimetres taller.#
TUVOK: Vulcans have the ability to meld telepathically with another's mind. I observed your husband's memories as Lieutenant Paris went through a cycle. I watched as the killer stabbed Professor Ren right here, through the intercostal space between the eighth and ninth right ribs, the exact location of the Banean heart. The killer clearly knew Banean anatomy. Lieutenant Paris did not.#
TUVOK: There is additional evidence. For example, we can now say for certain that Professor Ren was murdered by a Numiri agent.#
TUVOK: Lieutenant, did you notice the stream of symbols and numbers that were superimposed on the images?#
TUVOK: In researching this procedure, I found no other reference to this phenomenon. I have now confirmed that these symbols and numbers were equations taken from Professor Ren's weapons research. Someone intended them to be delivered to the Numiri.#
TUVOK: He was a logical courier. The Numiri agents knew he could leave the planet's surface without raising suspicion. The Numiri made two attempts to gain access to Mister Paris. They attacked just after he returned to Voyager, and then again when he was in the shuttle.#
TUVOK: You knew when Mister Paris would be in transit, Minister. The doctor is the one who encouraged you to release him to our custody. He is also the one who performed the implant procedure. I know of no one else who had the opportunity and knowledge to carry out this plan.#
TUVOK: Would you please stand again, Mrs Ren?#
TUVOK: You forget the other witness who was here on the night of the murder, Doctor. Would you mind asking her to come in? (The doctor opens the door indicated by Tuvok, and Neeka enters, jumping on her hind legs around him.) TUVOK: It appears that you are no stranger to Neeka, doctor.#
TUVOK: Mister Paris.#
TUVOK: It seemed a necessary step to ensure a truthful resolution.#
TUVOK: I conducted a criminal investigation. If you had been guilty, I assure you I would have pursued the truth just as vigilantly. You have no debt to me, Mister Paris.#
TUVOK: I prefer to read rather than engage in, what do humans call it? Short talk?#
TUVOK: Perhaps.#
TUVOK: No life signs, Captain. I'm broadening the scan. Nothing. He is nowhere in the entire asteroid field.#
TUVOK: It's no use, Captain. The vacuole is still forming.#
TUVOK: Take the body to the ship's morgue.#
TUVOK: The body of an alien female has been left behind.#
TUVOK: That kind of bonding should improve performance and maximise efficiency.#
TUVOK: The vessel is altering it's course to intercept us.#
TUVOK: Respite?#
TUVOK: Indeed.#
TUVOK: Since they've already said no, this kind of thinking is only going to make you feel worse.#
TUVOK: Captain, it occurs to me that we know little about the Sikarians. We cannot assume that their first refusal is unalterable. It may be that no is simply a prelude to negotiation.#
TUVOK: He may simply want us to believe that so we would deal with him.#
TUVOK: You would seem to have two options. Continue to negotiate with a man who may have a hidden agenda, or deal with a man who is willing to defy his own laws.#
TUVOK: At least if you deal with Jaret, it is his law that is being compromised, not ours.#
TUVOK: I believe the first thing you must do is determine whether Gath is willing to use the trajector to help us. If that possibility exists at all, you must explore it.#
TUVOK: I assume that means Gath will not be assisting us.#
TUVOK: Are you considering Jaret's offer?#
TUVOK: I altered the security sub-routines. Any attempt to over-ride the lock out would have alerted me to your presence here. Is this Voyager's library which you intended to trade for the trajector technology?#
TUVOK: When I attempted to download it, I noticed it had already been accessed.#
TUVOK: I will make the exchange with Jaret Otel. Return to your stations. Do what you can to prepare the ship for the matrix. Energise.#
TUVOK: Do not attempt to activate the device until I've spoken to Captain Janeway.#
TUVOK: Lieutenant Torres is not precisely correct, Captain. She was not the senior officer involved, I was.#
TUVOK: It was I who made the exchange. The Federation Library for the trajector matrix.#
TUVOK: It is quite simple, Captain. You have made it clear on many occasions that your highest goal for the crew is to get them home. But in this instance, your standards would not allow you to violate Sikarian law. Someone had to spare you the ethical dilemma. I was the logical choice, and so I chose to act.#
TUVOK: I accept the consequences of my actions. I expect to loose my commission and to be court-martialled when we return to Federation space.#
TUVOK: You have my word. My logic was not in error, but I was.#
TUVOK: Running scan.#
TUVOK: He's correct. I am picking up an ionization trail. There is another ship in orbit.#
TUVOK: It's not a cloaking device as we know it, Captain. I cannot say for certain what it is, but the ship does employ some kind of masking circuitry that has affected our sensors.#
TUVOK: The hull design does conform to known specifications of the Kazon-Nistrim sect.#
TUVOK: The ship's dimensions are identical to the vessel we encountered at the planet. It is a Kazon-Nistrim ship, Captain.#
TUVOK: It is likely that the ship's automatic containment systems were activated when the radiation entered the bridge. We should be safe as long as we stay on this side of the force field.#
TUVOK: It appears the explosion emanated from this console.#
TUVOK: The structural pattern does not conform to the rest of the bridge.#
TUVOK: There are only three alternatives I can discern at this time. One, it is not Federation technology at all but something similar.#
TUVOK: Two, another Federation starship may have been brought to the Delta Quadrant prior to our arrival, and they interacted with the Kazon-Nistrim.#
TUVOK: Three, someone from this ship has covertly given technology to the Kazon.#
TUVOK: Nevertheless, it is the most probable explanation. It may not be a coincidence that the Kazon ship we encountered at the planet was able to deceive our sensors. Perhaps someone transmitted instructions to them before we arrived.#
TUVOK: You did discover Ensign Seska in proximity to them.#
TUVOK: Nevertheless, I urge you to regard her with caution for the time being.#
TUVOK: The signal was masked by a test of the dorsal emitters that we conducted a week ago.#
TUVOK: We're trying to trace the station where the signal originated. Again, the perpetrator was skilled enough to make the tracking process extremely difficult for us.#
TUVOK: Perhaps someone else picked up the distress call.#
TUVOK: Captain, it is conceivable that she's gone to the Kazon ship to destroy evidence that might implicate her.#
TUVOK: Lieutenant, have you had any contact with the Kazon-Nistrim since we arrived in the Delta Quadrant?#
TUVOK: Nevertheless, a signal was sent to the Kazon from your station in Engineering during our dorsal emitter test last week.#
TUVOK: Were you not in Engineering at that time?#
TUVOK: Starfleet Security has documented several incidents in which Cardassian have used cosmetic alterations for the purpose of infiltrating an enemy.#
TUVOK: The Doctor has informed us that there's no other plausible explanation for the medical anomalies, Commander.#
TUVOK: Their weapon systems are standing down. They do not appear to be posing a threat to us at this time.#
TUVOK: Did you set our plan in motion? I gave Lieutenant Carey the same information.#
TUVOK: Gin.#
TUVOK: It is simply a matter of logical discards, which give a false impression of my own requirements and deny the needed cards to your hand. I believe that's ninety four points to me.#
TUVOK: Someone is accessing the inventory data base.#
TUVOK: Negative. It might alert them.#
TUVOK: Intriguing. It appears as though they're trying to place evidence at the scene of the crime to indicate the guilty party.#
TUVOK: Captain, even with our superior defence capabilities, we cannot prevail against three Kazon warships.#
TUVOK: As a Vulcan, I am at all times honest, Commander.#
TUVOK: I was honest to my own convictions within the defined parameters of my mission.#
TUVOK: On the contrary. The demands on a Vulcan's character are extraordinarily difficult. Do not mistake composure for ease. How may I be honest with you today?#
TUVOK: Like all humans, you depend on feelings and instincts to guide you, and they invariably let you down. But particularly naive? No, Commander, and I've always considered your attention span to be adequate.#
TUVOK: No. She quite expertly pulled the wool over my eyes as well.#
TUVOK: Curious.#
TUVOK: That my failure, added to your own, should improve your feelings.#
TUVOK: There is significant interference in the holodeck. I cannot obtain a clear scan.#
TUVOK: I do not believe so.#
TUVOK: Manual overrides are not functioning. I cannot terminate the programme.#
TUVOK: Beowulf?#
TUVOK: I'm not detecting any life signs but there's still considerable interference.#
TUVOK: Computer, delete character.#
TUVOK: We must also consider the possibility that the safety programmes are malfunctioning as well.#
TUVOK: We have no desire to trespass. However, we are on an urgent mission, so if you would allow us to continue, we would appreciate it.#
TUVOK: Grandiloquence notwithstanding, that would qualify as a description of Mister Kim. How did you know he was Beowulf?#
TUVOK: A reasonable assumption.#
TUVOK: We would like more information about Beowulf. Would it be possible to examine his body?#
TUVOK: If you would allow us to assist you, perhaps we could help alleviate your terror.#
TUVOK: We have no intention of slaying anyone. We simply wish to examine the creature.#
TUVOK: Such fables are necessary only in cultures which unduly emphasise emotional behaviour. I would point out there are no demons in Vulcan literature.#
TUVOK: It is an object approximately one metre in diameter.#
TUVOK: Captain, the holo-characters told us Kim was killed by Grendel. An examination of this part of the programme might be advisable.#
TUVOK: The attack lasted no more than a few seconds, but it was highly effective. I feel Commander Chakotay and I are fortunate to be alive.#
TUVOK: We had completed our trade mission with the Ilidarians and were on course to the rendezvous point when we encountered a dark matter nebula. As we began a routine analysis, an unidentified ship emerged and attacked our shuttle.#
TUVOK: No. They would not respond to our hails. We were hit by an energy discharge which penetrated our shields and filled the cabin. Commander Chakotay lost consciousness immediately, and I was barely able to activate the autopilot before I was overcome as well.#
TUVOK: The last image I saw was the ship flying back into the nebula, but the details are difficult to remember.#
TUVOK: No. There was no time for a detailed analysis. However, the shuttle's sensors may have recorded information that could be helpful. I will download the sensor logs.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: I agree.#
TUVOK: Is there a problem?#
TUVOK: This command station has been blocked.#
TUVOK: The lockout originated on deck twelve, section B seven, navigational control.#
TUVOK: Helm control re-established.#
TUVOK: We are merely following a line of deductive reasoning, Lieutenant. Both deviations from our course were apparently issued from locations where you were working.#
TUVOK: Your report, Doctor?#
TUVOK: On the contrary, Lieutenant. I ran a forensic sweep of the navigational control. I found traces of your DNA on the console.#
TUVOK: The cellular residue you left behind is less than twelve hours old. Do you still wish to maintain your innocence?#
TUVOK: Keep me informed, Doctor.#
TUVOK: I believe I have found the ion trail of the ship that attacked us. It leads directly into the dark matter nebula. This is the nebula, and this is the ion trail. As you can see, their flight path is highly erratic.#
TUVOK: A reasonable assumption. I recommend we follow their exact flight path.#
TUVOK: Intruder alert. All security personnel, go to Condition Four. Captain, it is possible the intruder returned with us in the shuttlecraft.#
TUVOK: Captain, Kes's telepathic abilities are undisciplined. If I could initiate a Vulcan mind-meld with her, I may be able to help her focus those abilities to detect the alien more accurately.#
TUVOK: Perhaps this type of energy is beyond our sensor bandwidth.#
TUVOK: Stay where you are, Mister Kim.#
TUVOK: I am reconfiguring the sensor relays on the ship. This will only take a minute.#
TUVOK: I am sorry, Doctor. Captain's orders. How is she?#
TUVOK: Odd. There was no physical struggle that I can recall.#
TUVOK: Lieutenant Torres and I will be ready to initiate the magneton scan in approximately two hours. You should be aware that it will be a high-intensity burst. It will cause dizziness and disorientation in all crew members, including myself, for several seconds.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. There is another matter of some concern. It appears that Kes's injuries were not caused by an energy discharge. The doctor has found evidence that she was physically assaulted.#
TUVOK: That is correct.#
TUVOK: Me?#
TUVOK: It is possible. Perhaps we should have the doctor run a neurological scan to see if I show a memory disruption.#
TUVOK: It appears the lockout originated somewhere above deck four.#
TUVOK: The Doctor does hold the command codes to Voyager.#
TUVOK: If we assume the alien could not take over the holographic doctor, then logically it would try to force the command codes back into a humanoid host.#
TUVOK: A sensible precaution.#
TUVOK: But presumably not both of us at the same time.#
TUVOK: Captain? (Janeway hits Tuvok, knocking him down. He draws a phaser but she kicks it out of his hand.) TUVOK: Stun her! She's the alien! (Paris obeys. Then Kim pulls his phaser and Paris disarms him. Next to try and shoot Tuvok is Durst, but he misses. Paris hits him then Tuvok stuns all the bridge crew with a wide burst.)#
TUVOK: I believe so. Mister Kim, lay in that course. Shields are at maximum, Captain. All preparations for entering the nebula are complete.#
TUVOK: I have no memory of injuring Kes. Perhaps I was occupied by the alien at that time.#
TUVOK: I am the Chief of Security. It may see me as a particular threat.#
TUVOK: Captain, I believe you are having a typically human response to circumstances which are frightening and inexplicable, commonly known as paranoia.#
TUVOK: I'm using a multiphasic scan. If you examine the alpha K band, you will see it.#
TUVOK:  Belay that order. That is exactly what the alien has been trying to do, keep us from entering the nebula. I suspect the captain has been occupied. I am relieving her of command. Ensign, proceed into the nebula, one half impulse.#
TUVOK: Now, Ensign.#
TUVOK: I must inform you this phaser is on wide beam dispersal and set to kill. I am taking command of this Bridge. I must ask you all to stand together where I can see you. Step away from the console, Ensign. (Tuvok takes over the operations console. The crew report to Janeway in hushed tones.)#
TUVOK: We are the Komar. This is our domain. (Down in Engineering, the thing flies around. Torres suddenly stiffens then goes to a control panel and does something. The ship jolts.)#
TUVOK: No. No! We must continue.#
TUVOK: Very perceptive, Captain. The collective neural energy of your crew will sustain my people for years to come.#
TUVOK: No apology is necessary.#
TUVOK: As I have told you, Mister Neelix, this is an unnecessary indulgence. I am quite content to eat whatever the rest of the crew is eating.#
TUVOK: Very well then, thank you.#
TUVOK: It is rather  piquant.#
TUVOK: I must point out that if you take the liberty of changing a time-honoured recipe you are hardly presenting a taste of home.#
TUVOK: Please, enjoy it.#
TUVOK: Then as we suspected, the dense magnesite formations in the planet's crust are blocking our sensors.#
TUVOK: And what is to prevent us from losing you as well, Commander?#
TUVOK: Commander, Ensign. Over here.#
TUVOK: I detect traces of at least five humanoid lifeforms.#
TUVOK: Evidently they did not enter this cavern alone.#
TUVOK: According to our last geological scan this cave should continue straight ahead for another eight kilometres.#
TUVOK: True, Commander, but I do not believe there has been any tectonic activity. I believe this wall is merely an illusion, a disguised force field.#
TUVOK: Captain, the energy configuration of the force field matrix is virtually identical to those used by the Vidiians.#
TUVOK: However, it is possible that the same technology that disguises their forcefields, cloaks their ships.#
TUVOK: Apparently it has been adapted to repulse phaser fire.#
TUVOK: That was our first thought. But we realised such an attempt would have to be at close range and would carry the risk of alerting the Vidiians to our presence.#
TUVOK: Of course, timing the transport to the precise moment of an opening would be critical.#
TUVOK: Precisely. But you should be aware that because we are incapable of scanning beyond the forcefield we will have no way of communicating with whoever transports inside it. Nor will we be able to verify that the transport has been successfully completed.#
TUVOK: I have done my best to replicate Vidiian attire. I trust it will prove sufficiently convincing.#
TUVOK: Captain. There's an opening forming in the forcefield.#
TUVOK: Targeting scanners to match coordinates. Scanners locked.#
TUVOK: The shot may be difficult, Mister Neelix, but to say that it is impossible is an exaggeration.#
TUVOK: Logic would dictate that if I strike the cue ball properly, it will deflect first off the rear bumper, then the side, striking the eleven ball and causing it to roll directly into the corner pocket.#
TUVOK: Perhaps the ship's stabilisers are not operating at peak efficiency.#
TUVOK: May we show you to your quarters?#
TUVOK: May I ask, Doctor, why you've taken it upon yourself to examine Mister Neelix?#
TUVOK: Computer, locate Doctor Jetrel.#
TUVOK: Captain, Doctor Jetrel is proposing the reconstruction and re-animation of a remarkable complex set of biosystems from billions of subatomic particles.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. Emergency containment field activated.#
TUVOK: Re-targeting scanners to wide beam.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: Affirmative.#
TUVOK: Atomic cohesion has dropped to forty nine percent, Captain.#
TUVOK: They are already at one hundred percent.#
TUVOK: Pattern buffers to one hundred and twenty percent of rated maximum.#
TUVOK: Atomic cohesion to thirty nine percent. Twenty two percent. Fourteen percent. His pattern is degrading rapidly.#
TUVOK: The degree of fragmentation is simply too great. It will not work. We are overloading the system.#
TUVOK: Tuvok to Lieutenant Torres. Has any equipment repair been authorised on Deck six? TORRES  Negative. What's going on? TUVOK: Stand by.#
TUVOK: Crewman Dalby, what are you doing here?#
TUVOK: Did you inform Lieutenant Torres?#
TUVOK: On this ship we have a protocol for such procedures.#
TUVOK: Your repair interrupted a number of ships functions. That is the problem.#
TUVOK: I would remind you, Mister Dalby, that you are no longer on a Maquis ship.#
TUVOK: Unknown. Lieutenant Torres is running a materials analysis on the gel pack. In the mean time the unit has been replaced.#
TUVOK: Forty seven.#
TUVOK: There is one other matter I wish to discuss. I am concerned about Crewman Dalby. He attempted to make unauthorised repairs on a damaged gel pack. When I confronted him, he lost control.#
TUVOK: He became extremely angry, to the point of insubordination.#
TUVOK: Indeed. This is not the first incident involving Mister Dalby. Last week he was found tampering with ship's systems to increase a friends replicator rations, and he has missed three of his last ten duty shifts.#
TUVOK: A starship cannot run without protocols. Mister Dalby's attitude is disrupting this vessels operations.#
TUVOK: Perhaps that would be the best approach.#
TUVOK: What do you propose?#
TUVOK: Me?#
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay would be a more logical choice to be their instructor. He is a Maquis, as well as their former Captain.#
TUVOK: Very well, Captain, I will prepare a curriculum.#
TUVOK: The answer to that question would seem to be self evident, crewman. Interrupting a senior officer is not acceptable behaviour. The purpose of this training is to familiarise you with Starfleet protocols so that mistakes like that will be minimised.#
TUVOK: Crewman Chell.#
TUVOK: Your report indicates that you are talkative, disruptive and unreliable. You promise to do tasks which then go undone.#
TUVOK: Crewman! From this point on you will speak only if you are spoken to.#
TUVOK: Forty laps around the cargo bay. Start running now.#
TUVOK: Fifty laps.#
TUVOK: As I was saying, this class will adhere to standards established for Starfleet cadets. There will be physical training and academic studies, as well as tactical situations which will be simulated on the holodeck. Crewman, have you been listening to me?#
TUVOK: Excuse me. I did not hear that answer.#
TUVOK: Speak up, crewman.#
TUVOK: From now on you will look at me when I am talking to you.#
TUVOK: What was that?#
TUVOK: We think he should.#
TUVOK: That is correct.#
TUVOK: Crewmen, you are demonstrating rank insubordination. I order all of you to stay where you are.#
TUVOK: These are your study assignments for next week. Please note that examinations will be conducted randomly with no advance notice. I will now inspect your uniforms. Crewman Henley, your headband is certainly festive.#
TUVOK: However, it is in violation of regulations. Please check the protocol files for recommended guidelines. What is this?#
TUVOK: This ornament is in violation of the dress code.#
TUVOK: You will remove it now.#
TUVOK: Correct. In addition, your boots are scuffed. From now on you will arrive in polished boots. GERRON Yes, sir. TUVOK: Do you have a problem, Mister Dalby?#
TUVOK: Very well. You will all report to me on deck eleven at nineteen hundred hours. Dismissed.#
TUVOK: You will find that out at nineteen hundred hours. Dismissed.#
TUVOK: Not that way, crewman. We are getting to deck thirteen by way of the mess hall.#
TUVOK: Correct. I am glad to see your knowledge of the ship's internal structure is improving. Crewman Gerron, lead the way. (Gerron starts up the ladder, followed by Chell, Henley, Dalby and Tuvok. Eventually Gerron stops on a ladder for a breather.)#
TUVOK: That was a run of approximately ten point one kilometres.#
TUVOK: You may be experiencing difficulty because I increased the gravity on this deck by ten percent.#
TUVOK: You never know what conditions you might encounter. You must be prepared for anything. Crewmen Gerron and Chell, you have not completed your run. By my account we have lapped you three times. You will finish the ten kilometres now. We will repeat this exercise tomorrow evening and I will expect each one of you to better your performance. [Transporter room] (Chell is scanning the transporter pads with a small hand-held device when Torres goes to Kim at the console.)#
TUVOK: You have the Bridge. The programme will present you with a series of random events which you and your crew must deal with in whatever manner you see fit.#
TUVOK: The programme will be initiated when you set a course.#
TUVOK: Computer, reset programme. Your first command together was less than successful. You are all dead.#
TUVOK: Can anyone answer that question?#
TUVOK: Mister Gerron, do you have something to add?#
TUVOK: It matters, because if you do not learn from your mistakes, you will be doomed to repeat them.#
TUVOK: And have you reached a conclusion as to your error?#
TUVOK: I see. Did the possibility of retreat not occur to you?#
TUVOK: The strongest tactical move is always the one in which you will reap the highest gain at the lowest cost. Going out with phasers firing may seem heroic, but in the long run it is merely foolish. Retreat is often the best possible option.#
TUVOK: Dismissed. Computer, exit. [Mess hall] (Tuvok is at the other side of his usual table, staring into space.)#
TUVOK: I assure you, you are wrong.#
TUVOK: I cannot imagine that there are visible emanations which allow you to interpret my mood. You are making wild assumptions.#
TUVOK: I do not believe they are responding well to my instruction.#
TUVOK: That is what I have been trying to determine, and I'm afraid I am at a loss. I have taught literally thousands of cadets and I have never encountered these difficulties. My methods are sound and time-honoured. I insist on strict adherence to rules and protocols. I never waver from that approach. I have always been successful in honing each cadet into a Starfleet officer.#
TUVOK: You're saying that the Maquis crew is rigid and inflexible. That they will never adjust to Starfleet rules.#
TUVOK: I am not sure if I have the ability to find out what they are like inside. Mister Neelix, what is that?#
TUVOK: Cheese. You must cultivate bacteria to make cheese.#
TUVOK: Where they were disseminated throughout the ship, subsequently infecting the bio-neural circuitry.#
TUVOK: Do you play pool often?#
TUVOK: Do you have a family?#
TUVOK: Pardon?#
TUVOK: I had thought we could get to know each other. Perhaps then our relationship would function more smoothly.#
TUVOK: I do, but there is nothing to report about them that would compare with your story. I've observed that you seem to be somewhat protective of Mister Gerron. Have you formed a friendship with him?#
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay specifically recommended Mister Gerron for this programme. He felt that if the young man were able to learn new skills, to set goals and accomplish them, it might go a long way to helping him feel better about himself.#
TUVOK: It is our intention that the experience be positive for everyone.#
TUVOK: Class dismissed. Return to your duty stations.#
TUVOK: Tuvok to Bridge. This is Lieutenant Tuvok, is anyone receiving this message? It appears our duty stations will have to do without us for the time being.#
TUVOK: I would surmise that the Captain is making some effort to deal with the systems failures. The fact that we do not know what that effort entails may lead us to imagine the worst. We must not let fear get the best of us. Mister Gerron, it is possible the console in the control room is still functioning. Please see if you can open the doors from there.#
TUVOK: In the mean time, we can attempt to access one of the Jeffries tubes through the forward bulkhead.#
TUVOK: The plasma gas will become toxic within minutes. We must leave immediately.#
TUVOK: Get in the Jeffries tube. I cannot risk losing any more of you to save one man.#
TUVOK: It is always tactically correct to sacrifice the few for the many.#
TUVOK: Get in the Jeffries tube now! Mister Dalby, I will break your arm if you do not follow my order.#
TUVOK: Keep moving. (Tuvok closes the hatch behind his trainees and runs across the cargo bay to the ladder.)#
TUVOK: It was. However, I recently realised that there are times when it is desirable to bend the rules.#
TUVOK: We were able to shut down the holodeck simulation that your programme was generating. Commander Chakotay transferred you back to Sickbay. You seem to have suffered no damage.#
TUVOK: No. In fact, except for the computer problems, it has been an uneventful day.#
TUVOK: Yes, Commander. His programme is functioning normally.#
TUVOK: Acknowledged.#
TUVOK: The swarm is not particularly dense, Captain. I estimate their number at fewer than two thousand.#
TUVOK: Sensors indicate an EM resonance field. The creatures seem to be creating their own magnetic wake. That is what is pulling the ship.#
TUVOK: Non-functional, Captain.#
TUVOK: What is the lunch special today?#
TUVOK: Very well. It will do.#
TUVOK: If it is all you are serving, that would stand to reason.#
TUVOK: Without.#
TUVOK: I have four.#
TUVOK: The question is so broad, it is difficult to respond.#
TUVOK: That is certainly true.#
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I am aware of your situation. It appears you are in some doubt as to the wisdom of becoming a parent.#
TUVOK: I can only tell you that if you have considerable doubts about fatherhood, it would not be wise to enter into the process. It is so much more overwhelming than one expects, that I believe only the most committed should become parents.#
TUVOK: However, I must point out that, as illogical as it seems, being a father can have infinite rewards. Far more than would seem possible. My children occupy a significant portion of my thoughts. Now more than ever.#
TUVOK: I experienced neither joy nor sorrow, but I do believe it is possible.#
TUVOK: If you say so. But I must point out that there is an equal chance that you would have a daughter.#
TUVOK: Why would it be any different from what you would teach a son?#
TUVOK: I have three sons and one daughter. I can assure you she benefits as much from my presence and guidance as my sons do. It is unfortunate that I must be so far removed from all of them now.#
TUVOK: Guidance, navigational and tactical systems are failing.#
TUVOK: Captain, I am detecting a substantial magnetic mass moving rapidly toward the port bow.#
TUVOK: Perhaps it is the parent.#
TUVOK: The larger creature is moving with us.#
TUVOK: Captain, the creature is reacting. It is approaching rapidly on a collision course.#
TUVOK: All hands brace for impact.#
TUVOK: I'm beginning to share Lieutenant Torres' views, Captain. Retaliation may become necessary.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. Probe launched.#
TUVOK: Treating the creature as it is treating us might be an appropriate response.#
TUVOK: Precisely.#
TUVOK: The creature is not retreating, Captain.#
TUVOK: It appears we have lost our sex appeal, Captain.#
TUVOK: Very good, Ensign.#
TUVOK: Acknowledged.#
TUVOK: I presume this notable impatience is due to your desire to attend the festivities in Holodeck two.#
TUVOK: May I remind you that your duty shift does not officially terminate for another thirty four minutes? However, I believe the holodeck power conduits would benefit from a routine inspection.#
TUVOK: All stop. Mister Kim.#
TUVOK: Magnify. I am afraid that holodeck inspection will have to wait, Ensign. [Holodeck - Sandrine's]#
TUVOK: Is the anomaly responsible for the comm. system malfunction?#
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Full reverse, Ensign.#
TUVOK: If we can not go around it, then we will have to go through it.#
TUVOK: From what you have told me, Ensign, the distortion ring will make contact with us momentarily whether we attempt to pass through it or not. I prefer to minimise the amount of time that contact lasts. Shields at maximum. Warp three. Engage.#
TUVOK: Find the Captain and inform her of our status.#
TUVOK: Gentlemen.#
TUVOK: That is an interesting question, Commander. I am not certain how I arrived at this location.#
TUVOK: Indeed. When I received no word from you or the Captain, I left Lieutenant Ayala in command and came to look for you myself.#
TUVOK: I do not believe so. When I first realised I was lost, I attempted to retrace my steps only to find myself here.#
TUVOK: Strange, I thought we were on deck three.#
TUVOK: The ring has penetrated our shields and is now in direct contact with the hull.#
TUVOK: As improbable as it sounds, that would appear to be the case.#
TUVOK: If we are indeed trapped in some sort of labyrinth, then the logical course is to systematically eliminate all routes which do not lead us to our desired destination. The route that remains will be the correct one. Since we have been making a series of right turns, we should continue to do so, until we are certain this path is not the proper one.#
TUVOK: How so, Commander?#
TUVOK: Even within chaotic systems, there is a pattern of limited predictability.#
TUVOK: That is a possibility.#
TUVOK: As you wish, Commander. (They head in opposite directions, and meet again at the next intersection.)#
TUVOK: Not only has no one been able to reach the Bridge, but the Captain came into contact with the spatial distortion and is now unconscious.#
TUVOK: It is likely that they too are trapped in other parts of the ship, cut off from communication and unable to find their way out.#
TUVOK: We would certainly benefit from having an accurate picture of what the ship currently looks like. That way we would have a better chance of getting where we want to go.#
TUVOK: Correct, Ensign. However, the area we occupying will not remain unaffected indefinitely.#
TUVOK: Based on the rate of implosion thus far, I estimate the ring will crush deck six in approximately sixty eight minutes. [Holodeck - Sandrine's]#
TUVOK: There is no clear evidence of an intelligence behind the phenomenon. It is still possible we are dealing with a naturally occurring anomaly which does not conform to the known laws of physics.#
TUVOK: Which could set off a chain reaction that would cause not only the ring to explode outward but Voyager along with it.#
TUVOK: That would be exceptionally difficult.#
TUVOK: I must remind you that with the comm. system down, we will have no effective means of alerting the rest of the crew to a potentially lethal particle shower.#
TUVOK: I believe it would be safer to attempt to access the navigational array and from there engage thrusters to steer us out of the ring.#
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay?#
TUVOK: I feel compelled to point out that in my many years of experience as Captain Janeway's tactical officer, she often demonstrated a tendency to follow my#
TUVOK: Yes, sir.#
TUVOK: I'm afraid there's no longer time for that.#
TUVOK: The distortion is unaffected by the force field.#
TUVOK: Perhaps not. So far, we have been unsuccessful in all our attempts to either explain or combat this phenomenon. And according to my calculations, the space we are currently occupying will implode in approximately three minutes seventeen seconds.#
TUVOK: We do nothing.#
TUVOK: Precisely.#
TUVOK: On the contrary. When every logical course of action is exhausted, the only option that remains is inaction.#
TUVOK: I must point out that at least one attempt we made to reverse the effect, the shock pulse, only made our predicament worse. If we continue desperately improvising solutions, our own efforts may ultimately kill us. On the other hand, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that doing nothing will result in death.#
TUVOK: We do not know that. At the moment, she is merely delirious.#
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay.#
TUVOK: I want to thank you for endorsing my recommendation.#
TUVOK: Thank you, sir. And since we are speaking candidly, may I say, sir, that I have not always been particularly partial to your methods either.#
TUVOK: I have always respected Captain Janeway's decisions. However, I suppose that particular decision did put me in a position I am unaccustomed to. If that ever caused me to make things more difficult for you, I must apologise.#
TUVOK: More than six hours ago.#
TUVOK: Captain, I am detecting an ion trail leading away from this location.#
TUVOK: The signature of the radiation is not consistent with Federation propulsion systems.#
TUVOK: From the dispersal pattern of the debris, we've been able to extrapolate Chakotay's course prior to the explosion. It appears he was heading for an M-class moon in this system.#
TUVOK: We tried to scan the surface, but there is intense radiothermic interference.#
TUVOK: As you wish, Captain, but I must point out that due to radiothermic interference, we will not be able to communicate with the ship.#
TUVOK: I would beg to differ. Based on these readings, that way would seem the logical choice.#
TUVOK: We could try remodulating the phasers to a higher frequency output.#
TUVOK: Negative. The signal is at maximum gain.#
TUVOK: Their last velocity vector indicates a steep descent. We've lost contact.#
TUVOK: They do not respond, Captain.#
TUVOK: Their vessel has taken up a position directly beneath us.#
TUVOK: They would seem to have adopted a defensive posture, Captain.#
TUVOK: I have anticipated your request, Captain. Am I correct in the assumption that you will want to use minimal force?#
TUVOK: I cannot guarantee success. My evaluation of their weapon systems suggest a capacity equal to our own. However#
TUVOK: I have. In my analysis of our first encounter, I have detected what I believe to be a vulnerability in their shield configuration. There appears to be a slight phase retraction when auxiliary power is transferred to their aft weapons systems.#
TUVOK: That was my ingenious plan, Commander. You are correct.#
TUVOK: So far I'm not detecting the same vulnerability in their shields this time, Captain. We may have to resort to additional force.#
TUVOK: Stand by, Captain. I'm detecting an opening.#
TUVOK: Direct hit to their aft control systems. Their weapons are disabled.#
TUVOK: Captain, the alien vessel is in pursuit.#
TUVOK: Negative. They are still disabled.#
TUVOK: Alien vessel closing to one thousand kilometres. Five hundred. Three hundred. It has passed us and is proceeding toward the surface.#
TUVOK: We're being hailed again, Captain.#
TUVOK: Captain!#
TUVOK: Captain! Listen to me! You are in Sickbay. You are all right. Captain!#
TUVOK: I am picking up a ship on long range sensors, Commander. It is a design we have not encountered before.#
TUVOK: They are hailing, Commander.#
TUVOK: I terminate the transmission, Commander, and made it look like an accidental interruption. I am concerned about some anomalous sensor readings.#
TUVOK: The Bothan ship is powering up weapons.#
TUVOK: Shields at eighty seven percent. Minor damage on decks four and twelve.#
TUVOK: Powering up lateral phaser arrays. Shields down to eighty three percent.#
TUVOK: A direct hit. However, their shields were not penetrated.#
TUVOK: We have hit their weapons array, but not severely enough to disable it.#
TUVOK: That last volley took our shields down to twenty one percent.#
TUVOK: The lead ship is hailing us, Commander.#
TUVOK: I do not understand how this can be.#
TUVOK: No. You are not my wife.#
TUVOK: Commander, there's something over here I think you should see.#
TUVOK: There have been other visitors to this moon recently.#
TUVOK: What is your basis for that conclusion, Commander?#
TUVOK: Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere?#
TUVOK: We are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading, Commander.#
TUVOK: It appears to be a rare variety of Cypripedium, of the Asiatic genus Paphiopedilum.#
TUVOK: In fact, I am, or more accurately I was, a breeder of prize Vulcan orchids.#
TUVOK: Commander. (He has found an elegant curved structure that looks like it is made of wood, and some hi-tech pieces of equipment nearby.)#
TUVOK: Commander?#
TUVOK: May I remind the Commander that Starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is made.#
TUVOK: As we have not yet established the inhabitants' intentions, it would not be a logical course of action.#
TUVOK: Would you at least permit me to advise the Captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position?#
TUVOK: For the record, I must take exception to these orders.#
TUVOK: I have no explanation, Commander. There is no storm activity indicated.#
TUVOK: We will never make it.#
TUVOK: Away team to Voyager. Emergency beam out. (Chakotay's comm. badge, which had fallen off his uniform, is also beamed away.)#
TUVOK: Just before the storm, he was using it to speak with you, Captain.#
TUVOK: I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, Captain. The logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off. The transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion. We are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach.#
TUVOK: It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities.#
TUVOK: It appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact, Captain. The cloaking device has been turned off and we are showing an alien population. I have located the shuttle. It may be possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing.#
TUVOK: Commander?#
TUVOK: Four to beam up, Voyager.#
TUVOK: Open yourself to the impressions around you. The thoughts, the minds that are on this ship. What do you hear?#
TUVOK: I believe you are sensing the thoughts of various crewmembers on board.#
TUVOK: See if you can isolate one of the voices. Imagine you are listening to a symphony and focusing on a single instrument.#
TUVOK: Try to maintain your emotional equanimity. You should not be concerned with success or failure.#
TUVOK: That is not unexpected. You have an emotional attachment to him which may have drawn your focus.#
TUVOK: If you are to succeed in honing your telepathic abilities, you must learn to control these emotional outbursts.#
TUVOK: Tomorrow I will teach you a Vulcan mind control technique that will help you inhibit your giggles.#
TUVOK: You may go.#
TUVOK: I concur. However, dead or alive, these are the remains of an alien entity we never fully understood. It may be prudent to place it in a level three biohazard containment field.#
TUVOK: And if we can find her she might have the ability to send us home.#
TUVOK: Captain, the Caretaker was a being of considerable power, and although his intent was not hostile, we were essentially at his mercy. I do not care to repeat that experience.#
TUVOK: Precisely. I have studied the Doctor's biochemical analysis of the Caretaker remains and I believe it is possible to create a sporocystian toxin, something which might debilitate the life form.#
TUVOK: No response. I am reading an energy surge from the station, possible weapons.#
TUVOK: Incoming message from the array.#
TUVOK: And we did not kill the Caretaker. He died of natural causes.#
TUVOK: A non-emotional response would be more useful.#
TUVOK: Do not underestimate your own potential, Kes. Your mental abilities are rapidly maturing.#
TUVOK: The energy in this cylinder is formulated to break down that enzyme. It would result in temporary paralysis.#
TUVOK: It is my hope we only have to use it as a precautionary measure.#
TUVOK: That is a large step for someone whose mental abilities are still undisciplined. Nevertheless, I am intrigued.#
TUVOK: Please.#
TUVOK: Fascinating. However, I would advise caution in exploring this ability until you have mastered the#
TUVOK: What happened?#
TUVOK: That will not be necessary, Doctor. My Vulcan healing techniques do not require an extended period of convalescence.#
TUVOK: Of course.#
TUVOK: You are probably feeling the emotion known as remorse, possibly guilt. I advise you to look on this incident as a learning experience.#
TUVOK: That is correct. But you did not. Try to remember that. I will see you tomorrow at fifteen hundred hours, assuming you wish to continue your training.#
TUVOK: If this experience proves anything, it is that you need further instruction, and I would regret not continuing as your instructor.#
TUVOK: Security, meet me in main Engineering.#
TUVOK: Tuvok to Bridge.#
TUVOK: I believe the female Caretaker is here.#
TUVOK: Captain.#
TUVOK: Negative. The rupture has been sealed. She is gone, Captain. Captain's log, supplemental. We've resumed our course back to the Alpha quadrant but the female Caretaker is still out there with the power to send us home, and I will use all my power to find her and convince her to do just that. [Tuvok's quarters]#
TUVOK: Nevertheless, your psychokinetic abilities are still a part of you. They might resurface one day.#
TUVOK: To which part are you referring?#
TUVOK: Without the darkness, how would we recognise the light? Do not fear your negative thoughts. They are part of you. They are a part of every living being, even Vulcans.#
TUVOK: The Vulcan heart was forged out of barbarism and violence. We learned to control it, but it is still part of us. To pretend it does not exist is to create an opportunity for it to escape. Let us begin. Open yourself to the impressions around you. The thoughts, the minds that are on this ship.#
TUVOK: I have a source on the signal.#
TUVOK: Negative. It appears to be a beacon of some kind.#
TUVOK: We are being hailed by someone using a Federation signal.#
TUVOK: The carrier wave frequency does correspond to standard Starfleet security codes.#
TUVOK: According to the encryption key, this particular code was not scheduled for implementation until stardate 48423.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. Targeting scanners locked. Initiating tractor beam.#
TUVOK: We are taking fire from inside the cloud.#
TUVOK: Unknown.#
TUVOK: A Kazon raider is closing at one five eight mark nine.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: An opening is forming in the starboard shields, seventy two centimetres in diameter.#
TUVOK: They are continuously matching their weapons frequency to our shield frequency.#
TUVOK: The diameter of the opening has widened to approximately two metres.#
TUVOK: Aye, Commander. Diameter of the opening is now approximately four metres.#
TUVOK: Captain, I am picking up a smaller vessel emerging from the hydrogen cloud. It is heading directly toward the opening in our shields.#
TUVOK: Structural integrity is at fifty percent and dropping. The hull is starting to buckle.#
TUVOK: I am trying to initiate an emergency containment field. However, the collision has caused a power failure on deck four.#
TUVOK: Containment field activated.#
TUVOK: Tuvok to Security. Meet me outside Cargo Bay two.#
TUVOK: Drop your weapons. (One Kazon gets shot, the other two blast out of the cargo bay into Voyager.)#
TUVOK: I'm on my way. [Transporter room] (The remaining two Kazon take a module from a wall panel then beam out just as Tuvok enters.) TUVOK: Tuvok to Bridge.#
TUVOK: The Kazon have beamed away, Captain, and they've taken one of our transporter modules with them.#
TUVOK: Until now, the Kazon have never had an advisor with Cardassian, Maquis and Starfleet tactical experience.#
TUVOK: Perhaps Commander Chakotay could use his intimate knowledge of Seska to manipulate her in much the same way she manipulated us. [Kazon briefing room]#
TUVOK: Apparently he was able to override the lockout command.#
TUVOK: I assure you, Captain, it will not happen again.#
TUVOK: I have accessed his personal logs, but there is no reference to his leaving Voyager.#
TUVOK: Approximately three hours.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. [Kazon bridge]#
TUVOK: The beacon is transmitting an automated message. It is from Commander Chakotay.#
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay has expressly requested that we not attempt to do so.#
TUVOK: If a rescue attempt forces us to engage the Kazon, there is always a possibility that more of our technology will fall into their hands.#
TUVOK: I have located the Nistrim vessel on long-range sensors. Distance, point four light years. However, they are not alone. There are now at least six other Kazon ships in the immediate vicinity.#
TUVOK: That may be so, but the ships have not powered their weapons systems.#
TUVOK: If the Nistrim have added six ships to their force, it would be tactically unwise to engage them.#
TUVOK: We would have to slow down once within transporter range, giving the Kazon ample time to open fire.#
TUVOK: Ensign Kim is correct. We would risk scrambling his transporter signal and killing him. It would be a direct violation of Starfleet's safety protocols.#
TUVOK: Firing phasers.#
TUVOK: Here are the terms, gentlemen. The safe return of our First Officer and shuttlecraft in exchange for your freedom. I presume you will find that an acceptable arrangement. Captain's log, stardate 49211.5. Now that Commander Chakotay has made a full recovery, I'm faced with the difficult task of responding to his failure to follow procedure. [Ready room]#
TUVOK: I have located an automated message beacon, Captain.#
TUVOK: It is a message to Commander Chakotay from Seska.#
TUVOK: Captain. (The local police, in black leather and motorcycle helmets enter. They try to get away but the police grab them. Tuvok stuns one, Janeway and Torres fight others.)#
TUVOK: I advise caution.#
TUVOK: I regret I have no such reassurance to offer you.#
TUVOK: That is possible. It is also possible that she is safely returned to Voyager. We have insufficient evidence to dismiss either conclusion.#
TUVOK: I deny that we are intending to supply them with weapons.#
TUVOK: I have none to give you.#
TUVOK: Lieutenant, stop! That will not help either of us.#
TUVOK: Vulcans are capable of suppressing certain levels of physical pain. Beyond that we must simply endure the experience.#
TUVOK: Under the circumstances, physical resistance is ineffective. We are fighting back by refusing to give them any information.#
TUVOK: I must remind you that it is also a potential security risk.#
TUVOK: I suggest we allow the power to drain. We should take the opportunity to examine it while it is idle. Then we can decide if it is wise to repair it.#
TUVOK: We're being scanned, Captain.#
TUVOK: They have erected some kind of subspace defence field around their vessel. Our targeting scanners cannot penetrate it.#
TUVOK: Negative.#
TUVOK: Understood.#
TUVOK: Phasers calibrated.#
TUVOK: Their field strength is down to eighty percent.#
TUVOK: Our aft shields are down to fifty three percent and dropping.#
TUVOK: Down to twenty four percent.#
TUVOK: Hull breach on deck six.#
TUVOK: Environmental control systems are failing. Oxygen levels on decks three through seven have dropped to critical.#
TUVOK: The robots have powered down their weapon systems.#
TUVOK: Aft shields are still completely non-functional.#
TUVOK: In that case I suggest we make warp drive our priority. Any rescue attempt will no doubt necessitate a rapid departure.#
TUVOK: It would be advisable to create a diversion of some sort to take their attention away from the shuttle.#
TUVOK: They appear to be manned by automated units virtually identical to those operating the first ship.#
TUVOK: Captain, this new ship could be#
TUVOK: Mister Paris, reset your heading for coordinates one zero five#
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Showing a rift in the defence#
TUVOK: The ships are continuing to exchange fire, Captain. They are ignoring the shuttle.#
TUVOK: Captain, based on our readings, it appears we've been transported back in time to the birth of the universe.#
TUVOK: I am curious. Have the Q always had an absence of manners, or is it the result of some natural evolutionary process that comes with omnipotence?#
TUVOK: That is one relevant example.#
TUVOK: So it seems.#
TUVOK: Intriguing. Just what vulnerabilities do the Q have?#
TUVOK: Why are you telling me this?#
TUVOK: Me? I have no legal expertise.#
TUVOK: It is true that Vulcans who reach a certain infirmity with age, do practice ritual suicides. Nevertheless, I fail to see how that fact would be meaningful in this circumstance.#
TUVOK: Tell me Q, can you offer any other evidence of mental instability on the part of my client?#
TUVOK: In fact, until this issue arose, he was known in the Continuum as one of your great philosophers. Is that not true?#
TUVOK: So, your entire basis for judging him mentally unbalanced is his wish to commit suicide. I submit that is a faulty premise. In many cultures, suicide is acceptable, and in and of itself cannot be used as evidence of mental illness.#
TUVOK: Is it not true that on occasion the Continuum has executed Qs for certain crimes?#
TUVOK: Didn't their deaths create an interruption to the Continuum?#
TUVOK: Do you?#
TUVOK: I understand. And you find nothing contradictory in a society that outlaws suicide but practices capital punishment?#
TUVOK: Just one other thing. Isn't it true that you yourself were once accused of being mentally unstable by the Continuum? Were you not you disciplined for inappropriate behaviour?#
TUVOK: I will take that as a yes. Thank you. That is all.#
TUVOK: I am as curious as you are, Captain.#
TUVOK: Has it not been established that my client has in captivity during all of Commander Riker's lifetime?#
TUVOK: May I remind this hearing, and my learned colleague, that for three centuries, my client has not been allowed contact with anyone. At this time, we would like to reproduce the environment in which he has been confined.#
TUVOK: These are the conditions my client would be forced to live in for eternity if you deny asylum, Captain.#
TUVOK: I would submit that the quality of life that my client will have to endure should be considered in this proceeding.#
TUVOK: I believe it relates to the relief of suffering, does it not, Captain.#
TUVOK: May I request a recess to consider our response, Captain?#
TUVOK: I would say we have not yet convinced Captain Janeway of the validity of our argument.#
TUVOK: I am representing your position to the best of my ability. It is most definitely not my own. I see no persuasive evidence that a life like yours should be wasted simply because you are disgruntled. Frankly, I see no logic to your position.#
TUVOK: Then perhaps what we should do next is take this hearing to see life in the Continuum itself. Captain's log, supplemental. I'm determined to find a better alternative to suicide or endless prison, so I've summoned the advocate Q to make him a proposal. [Ready room]#
TUVOK: By going to the Continuum itself.#
TUVOK: My client has the right to ask for an inspection of the living conditions that lead to his suffering, Captain.#
TUVOK: Then what is the purpose of the road?#
TUVOK: I'm afraid I cannot hear any.#
TUVOK: Doctor, do you generally keep samples of fatal poisons in storage?#
TUVOK: The replicators will not produce them either.#
TUVOK: You assisted his suicide?#
TUVOK: Captain, shields are down as are all weapons arrays.#
TUVOK: Captain, my readings indicate the navigational deflector has sustained massive damage. It will be necessary to repair it before we can achieve more than thruster power.#
TUVOK: Come in. Captain, this is unexpected.#
TUVOK: Indeed, but so rarely that I can remember each instance. Vulcan spice tea, hot. And it was always at a time when you were particularly troubled.#
TUVOK: I am sure that made you uncomfortable.#
TUVOK: Quite right.#
TUVOK: You are perceptive, Captain. I believe Commander Chakotay's suggestion does have merit.#
TUVOK: When I was a young man, a great visionary named Spock recommended an alliance between the Federation and the Klingon empire. This produced a major dispute. The Klingons, after all, were outlaws, employing violence and brutality in order to build their empire. I myself spoke out against such a coalition. But the alliance was forged and it brought a stability to the quadrant that had not been there for two hundred years. Spock's suggestion, so controversial at first, proved to be the cornerstone of peace.#
TUVOK: I understand your concern, but remember, it would only be a temporary arrangement since we are on our way out of this quadrant. In the meantime, it might bring stability to the region and security for us.#
TUVOK: Perhaps. But even temporary stability can bring an appreciation for peace. This flower is a rare hybrid. As far as I know it exists nowhere else in the galaxy. I created it by grafting a cutting from a South American orchid onto a Vulcan favinit plant. I doubted the graft would take, and indeed the plant was sickly at first. However, after a few weeks both plants adapted to their new condition and in fact became stronger than either had been alone. [Briefing room]#
TUVOK: Is he authorised to speak for his Maje?#
TUVOK: What we will not provide is any of our technology or weaponry.#
TUVOK: Perhaps you should define that.#
TUVOK: Long range sensors indicate no sign of Mister Neelix's shuttle within a radius of two light years.#
TUVOK: We cannot jump to conclusions. He may simply have been delayed.#
TUVOK: Confirmed, Captain.#
TUVOK: It appears to be an armada, and the weapons are powered.#
TUVOK: Still, I do not see that it is a particularly good idea to form an alliance with the blood enemies of the Kazon. We risk uniting all the factions against us.#
TUVOK: What was he doing when the Kazon Pommar arrested him?#
TUVOK: If that is true, then one of them will undoubtedly try to leave before the meeting is finished.#
TUVOK: I would suggest we depart before the Kazon have a chance to return to their ships.#
TUVOK: I will schedule additional battle drills for all hands.#
TUVOK: He's exceeding our maximum velocity. I am switching to long range sensors.#
TUVOK: He is approaching the threshold. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane]#
TUVOK: I don't believe so. Sensors indicate that he did cross the warp threshold.#
TUVOK: Captain, there's a quantum surge off the port bow. Something is coming out of subspace.#
TUVOK: Are you saying Lieutenant Paris is evolving?#
TUVOK: The female, obviously. (Three baby salamanders emerge from a hole in the sand and slither off into the water.)#
TUVOK: I look forward to reading it. First Officer's log, supplemental. We've transported the Captain and Mister Paris back to Sickbay. As for their offspring, I've decided to leave them in their new habitat.#
TUVOK: The holiday of Kal Rekk is not for two weeks.#
TUVOK: There is no Kal Rekk season. Kal Rekk is a day of atonement, solitude and silence.#
TUVOK: Why would you need to do research on Vulcan holidays?#
TUVOK: Morale is irrelevant to a Vulcan.#
TUVOK: Then you will not rest.#
TUVOK: The Rumarie is an ancient pagan festival.#
TUVOK: That has not been observed for a millennium.#
TUVOK: Acknowledged.#
TUVOK: It appeared that Mister Darwin entered the conduit to repair a faulty circuit when the accident occurred.#
TUVOK: Perhaps he fell and hit his head in the conduit.#
TUVOK: I don't recall observing anything unusual about Mister Suder's behaviour while I was on your ship.#
TUVOK: I find it curious that none of this was included in your initial crew evaluation, Commander.#
TUVOK: Considering the fact that your Maquis crew included malcontents, outlaws and mercenaries, I believe it would have been appropriate.#
TUVOK: Sit down. You were alone in Engineering when Crewman Darwin reported for duty last night.#
TUVOK: Did you speak to him?#
TUVOK: And what was that?#
TUVOK: I have accused no one at this time. Did you kill Crewman Darwin?#
TUVOK: I will be speaking to everyone in Engineering, perhaps everyone on this ship, not just former members of the Maquis.#
TUVOK: I assure you, I have no feelings about the Maquis.#
TUVOK: As hard as it may be for you to understand, that did not require any feelings on my part. The Doctor places the time of death at twenty two fourteen. Do you remember what you were doing then?#
TUVOK: Would you be surprised to know that your console was logged off at twenty two oh nine?#
TUVOK: Do you have a criminal record, Mister Suder?#
TUVOK: Why would you have any reason to lie?#
TUVOK: Do you have a criminal record?#
TUVOK: How would you describe your relationship with Crewman Darwin?#
TUVOK: No disagreements?#
TUVOK: No fights?#
TUVOK: No reason to kill him?#
TUVOK: You are dismissed, Crewman. I may have more questions for you later.#
TUVOK: Go ahead, Doctor.#
TUVOK: Yes. They were retrieved from inside the head wound by nanites that I designed to recognise unusual DNA patterns. This DNA was isolated because it didn't belong to the victim. TUVOK: Have you matched it to a member of the crew?#
TUVOK: Are you certain?#
TUVOK: I must advise you that under Starfleet Directive one zero one you do not have to answer any questions.#
TUVOK: Crewman, I suggest you speak to counsel.#
TUVOK: Why did you kill him, Mister Suder?#
TUVOK: That is not a satisfactory answer. You must have had some motive.#
TUVOK: No.#
TUVOK: And no established motive.#
TUVOK: Crime must have a logical purpose.#
TUVOK: Doctor, is it possible that Mister Suder is psychotic?#
TUVOK: Why didn't you report this immediately after your examination, Doctor?#
TUVOK: In fact I do. Nevertheless, my job is not finished until I determine a motive.#
TUVOK: One may not recognise the motivation, but there is always motivation.#
TUVOK: Do you believe that a look by Mister Darwin could provoke such a violent reaction?#
TUVOK: I do not accept that explanation.#
TUVOK: You didn't like the way he looked at you.#
TUVOK: Just how did he look at you?#
TUVOK: So this murder could in fact be explained as an outburst of rage against Starfleet.#
TUVOK: I want the truth.#
TUVOK: Yes?#
TUVOK: In my case, you have a motive. My previous mission as a spy, my role as your accuser. But to my knowledge, Crewman Darwin had done nothing to you.#
TUVOK: Then why chose him as a victim?#
TUVOK: Do you feel remorse?#
TUVOK: I'll have to discuss that with the Captain.#
TUVOK: It is important that I understand why you killed Mister Darwin.#
TUVOK: You can. And indirectly I may be able to help you as well. Do you know what a mind meld is?#
TUVOK: We would be telepathically linked, exchanging our thoughts. In essence, becoming one mind.#
TUVOK: It is not without risk, but as a Vulcan I have internal processes that allow me to control violent instincts. I believe I will be able to suppress whatever feelings I draw from you.#
TUVOK: It is likely that you will gain, at least for a time, some of my self discipline to better control your violent nature.#
TUVOK: Release the forcefield. (Ayala draws his phaser then releases the cell forcefield. Tuvok enters.) TUVOK: My mind to your mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. [Holodeck - Sandrine's]#
TUVOK: It is difficult for me to accept, Captain, but Mister Suder was telling the truth as he knew it. He is a man with an incredibly violent nature living in an environment without any outlet to express it. I am surprised he was able to maintain his self control for as long as he did.#
TUVOK: If we were home, he'd be sent to prison.#
TUVOK: Nor would it be appropriate to leave him in the custody of someone in this quadrant.#
TUVOK: Captain, he is prepared to die for his crime.#
TUVOK: I only mention it because of the extenuating circumstances, and because he feels it would be an appropriate punishment.#
TUVOK: Pardon me, Captain, but allowing him the comfort of his own quarters doesn't seem an appropriate punishment for murder.#
TUVOK: Crewman Darwin's three sisters might not agree.#
TUVOK: Quite calm and controlled. Clearly the meld initiated some high cortical activity in his brain.#
TUVOK: I will admit that I am more disconcerted than I anticipated.#
TUVOK: Thank you, but I am already taking steps to purge these residual feelings. I don't believe time off will be necessary. I will of course advise you of any further complications.#
TUVOK: I really want you to leave.#
TUVOK: Please, go away.#
TUVOK: What must I do to convince you to stop.#
TUVOK: Computer, end holodeck programme. [Holodeck - Sandrine's]#
TUVOK: How are you feeling?#
TUVOK: Don't be misled. Your violent instincts still exist. You are simply suppressing them as Vulcans do.#
TUVOK: Understand that this will not be a permanent change unless you commit to a strict daily regime of meditation and mental exercise. I also believe that a series of holodeck programmes designed to allow your violent tendencies to be released in a safe environment may help to purge your aggressive impulses.#
TUVOK: Has anyone ever suggested targeted neurosynaptic therapy?#
TUVOK: Our Doctor is programmed with the medical knowledge of every Federation world. Perhaps he'll know of some treatment you haven't tried.#
TUVOK: Difficult?#
TUVOK: I have studied violence for over a hundred years.#
TUVOK: Attractive?#
TUVOK: On the contrary. I find it disturbing.#
TUVOK: Again?#
TUVOK: That would not be advisable.#
TUVOK: I don't understand why you#
TUVOK: Delete security clearance Tuvok one four nine four lambda.#
TUVOK: Please inform the Captain that I am no longer fit for duty.#
TUVOK: I would advise you not to enter, Captain.#
TUVOK: Please, do not come any closer.#
TUVOK: I said, don't come any closer.#
TUVOK: It would be safer for the crew if I were to remain in these quarters. I remind you, I am trained in the martial arts of many Alpha quadrant cultures. Sitting here, attempting to meditate, I have counted the number of ways I know of killing someone using just a finger, a hand, a foot. I had reached ninety four when you entered.#
TUVOK: Again, for safety reasons, I recommend you sedate me before you initiate transport.#
TUVOK: Something has changed.#
TUVOK: I feel.#
TUVOK:  Of course I know where I am, Captain. I'm just not sure I know who I am.#
TUVOK: Oh, it must be working, because I feel very strong. Very powerful. Quite euphoric. This must be how my ancestors felt. Doctor, would you consider allowing me to remain this way for a while? It would be a valuable opportunity for me to study primal Vulcan behaviour.#
TUVOK: You are not invulnerable, hologram. A few well chosen commands to the computer and you will cease to exist.#
TUVOK: You look shocked, Captain. You must be asking yourself, what if this doesn't work? What do we do then? I have an idea. I'll just stay in my quarters for the rest of the trip. I'll just relax and read, eat the ship's food, use the ship's energy, all in the comforts of my own room. Why, even Mister Suder and I could get together for a few hands of Cardassian pinochle once or twice a week. That is how we treat violent offenders on this ship, isn't it?#
TUVOK: I could be. Just like Suder. You know, Captain, I don't mind telling you something the other Tuvok never would. You are wrong. Sparing Suder's life is a sign of weakness. You disgust me. All you humans do. Admit it! Part of you feels as I do. Part of you wants him to die for what he did.#
TUVOK: Liar! He has killed and you know he deserves to die! On behalf of the victim's family, Captain, I beg you to reconsider. Give them the satisfaction of his execution. I have a radical suggestion, Captain. Release the forcefield and I'll kill him for you. Release the forcefield.  My student, my prot�g�e. there is so much for each of us to learn today, isn't there.#
TUVOK: Listen to what I tell you. Release the forcefield.#
TUVOK: Release the forcefield!#
TUVOK: There were some complications from the meld.#
TUVOK: I've been undergoing neurosynaptic therapy in Sickbay.#
TUVOK: No.#
TUVOK: To execute you for your crime.#
TUVOK: I will take no comfort in this.#
TUVOK: It needs to be done.#
TUVOK: To serve justice.#
TUVOK: I seek no return!#
TUVOK: My mind to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. My mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts. (They sink to their knees, and finally Tuvok releases him before collapsing. Suder rolls him over and uses his comm. badge.)#
TUVOK: Captain, I must apologise for my inappropriate behaviour.#
TUVOK: I was most insulting to you.#
TUVOK: I hope you understand that I have always had the greatest respect for you as a Captain, and consider you a friend.#
TUVOK: The high residual energy signature indicates repeated weapons fire.#
TUVOK: Enough to destroy a small moon.#
TUVOK: Perhaps the missile's navigational system is malfunctioning. It's been operating for over a year, far longer than it was designed to function.#
TUVOK: No discernable damage, Captain.#
TUVOK: Ready Captain.#
TUVOK: The missile's thoron shock emitter has fired.#
TUVOK: We have penetrated its shields. Direct hit to the core.#
TUVOK: The missile was not significantly damaged. It has maintained its course for Rakosa. [Ready room]#
TUVOK: The Rakosan attack is commencing, Captain.#
TUVOK: Firing phasers.#
TUVOK: We are drawing minimal fire from the missile. It's primary weapons systems are focused on the Rakosan vessel.#
TUVOK: Shields at forty percent.#
TUVOK: Or more to the point, it would take a warp core breach.#
TUVOK: It is logical to have a second in command in case you are injured and unable to complete the mission, Captain. I request permission to remain.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: I don't believe there are any serious concerns, Captain. There is no need to withhold this information any longer.#
TUVOK: He has been disruptive, and often sets a bad example for the rest of the crew.#
TUVOK: All systems are functional.#
TUVOK: We have recently experienced a plasma overload. That could easily account for the anomalous readings in the logs.#
TUVOK: What are you suggesting?#
TUVOK: To what end?#
TUVOK: That's an extremely serious charge.#
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I strongly suspect that your enthusiasm for your new journalistic endeavour is leading you to see villains where none exist. However, even the possibility that someone on board might secretly be communicating with the Kazon deserves investigation. I will pursue the matter.#
TUVOK: I think not. This is now a matter of ship security. I must ask you to withdraw and let me handle it according to Starfleet protocols.#
TUVOK: And I have the higher obligation to keep you from putting yourself and others at risk. You will drop this matter.#
TUVOK: When I looked for signal correlation traces, there were none. That means someone placed them in the system after my initial investigation.#
TUVOK: However, we were unable to ascertain who that person was.#
TUVOK: That is correct. It was important that his decision to leave the ship appear plausible, so he began behaving like a malcontent.#
TUVOK: I was the one who recommended to Captain Janeway that you not be told. I suspected that the spy was a Maquis, and felt it was wrong to put you in a position of setting a trap for someone who had once served under you.#
TUVOK: Perhaps we should take advantage of Mister Neelix's unintentional blunder.#
TUVOK: We would keep an open comm. link to you at all hours. My security team could act immediately if anything were to happen.#
TUVOK: Are you injured?#
TUVOK: Commander, I am picking up a distress call on one of the upper subspace bands.#
TUVOK: A small spacecraft. No weapon systems. One life form aboard. Extremely weak life signs.#
TUVOK: Preliminary scans show no other Vidiian ships in this sector. It is unlikely that this is a trap.#
TUVOK: Yes, Captain.#
TUVOK: Indeed. During the birth of our third child, my wife was in labour for ninety six hours.#
TUVOK: I have learned that pregnancy and patience go hand in hand.#
TUVOK: Captain, long-range sensors are picking up heavy subspace communications ahead. They're Vidiian.#
TUVOK: At least twenty ships within sensor range. I am also detecting a G type star system with two inhabited planets. Life signs, Vidiian.#
TUVOK: It appeared to be a proton burst.#
TUVOK: Captain, these bursts are weakening the structural integrity of the hull. We cannot take any more.#
TUVOK: Hull breach on deck fifteen, section twenty nine alpha. Emergency force fields are offline.#
TUVOK: Damage reports are coming in. The hull breach on deck fifteen has widened to include deck fourteen, section twelve. And there are six hundred thirty two micro-fractures along the hull's infrastructure. All primary systems are offline. We are running on emergency power only. The antimatter supply has dropped to eighteen percent and is continuing to fall. Warp coils in both nacelles have fused and are inoperative. The environmental control systems are failing. Fifteen crew members have been seriously wounded with plasma burns, twenty seven experienced other injuries. The Doctor is setting up triage facilities in Sickbay and Holodeck two. I must also regretfully report that Ensign Wildman's baby did not survive.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: The fire suppression system is out.#
TUVOK: Could this possibly be some kind of subterfuge, Captain? An alien deception?#
TUVOK: Tuvok to Janeway. Ensign Kim has made it through the rift, with the infant.#
TUVOK: I am curious, Captain. Before the Vidiians attacked, when you were in disagreement with the other Captain about#
TUVOK: One could say that you were both the doubter and the doubted. I do not envy the paradox of logic you were faced with in that situation.#
TUVOK: Tuvok to Voyager. Voyager, do you read? You must lie still.#
TUVOK: Several of your vertebrae have been fractured.#
TUVOK: I'm afraid the shuttle's medical supplies are inadequate. We must wait for Voyager to find us.#
TUVOK: I want you to slow your breathing, and relax your muscles. Try not to move.#
TUVOK: I believe Ensign Macormak would miss you a great deal.#
TUVOK: It's all right, don't be frightened. I won't hurt you.#
TUVOK: Will you run if I do?#
TUVOK: My name is Tuvok. Who are you?#
TUVOK: I am not a member of your race. I am Vulcan. I thought this moon was uninhabited. Do you live here?#
TUVOK: Where are your parents?#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: I put a stasis field around his body to protect it until I can take it back to my ship.#
TUVOK: Some cultures, like Mister Bennet's, consider an appropriate burial to be a sign of respect. Tressa, is there anyone else here with you?#
TUVOK: There is no one looking after you?#
TUVOK: There is no reason to be afraid. I will take care of you now and see that you get home safely. (The second girl and the boy run over and hug Tuvok, then Tressa joins in.) Captain's log, supplemental. I've sent out scouting parties to analyse the mineral deposits in the moons around Drayan Two. Meanwhile, I've arranged to meet with the planet's leader.#
TUVOK: Yes. I have secured his body within a stasis field. You were all very fortunate to have escaped the crash with only a few bruises.#
TUVOK: Attendants?#
TUVOK: We cannot leave yet. My shuttle is in need of repairs.#
TUVOK: I believe so. However, I am more concerned with getting through the electrodynamic turbulence in the ionosphere.#
TUVOK: A thermal inversion gradient is causing unusually strong and unpredictable currents in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Those currents caused my shuttle to crash, and I assume yours as well. I must find a way to safely navigate through the turbulence before we can attempt to leave.#
TUVOK: It may. You must be patient.#
TUVOK: Your displeasure doesn't change our situation. Nor does it bring us any closer to a solution#
TUVOK: It isn't my intention to be mean. I only wish to provide you with a realistic assessment. Vulcan parents never shield their children from the truth. Doing so would only hinder their ability to cope with inevitable difficulties.#
TUVOK: There is a supply of Starfleet rations in the shuttle.#
TUVOK: Concentrated vitamin enriched nutritional supplements.#
TUVOK: We have only rations. Now, I must begin working on my shuttle. By my estimate we have fewer than four hours of daylight remaining.#
TUVOK: Is that some species of animal?#
TUVOK: I'm not detecting any life forms other than ourselves.#
TUVOK: Have any of you ever seen this creature?#
TUVOK: I believe your anxiety about our situation is causing you to imagine the presence#
TUVOK: Were either of them injured?#
TUVOK: But both were able to walk.#
TUVOK: Did any of you hear them get up during the night?#
TUVOK: The other children aren't within scanning range of this tricorder. That is the only thing we know for certain at this time.#
TUVOK: Children, you are allowing your fears to guide you. You must learn to exercise control over your own imagination.#
TUVOK: Yes, the existence of such a creature is one possibility. However, your emotional reactions are preventing you from accurately judging how unlikely that is to be true.#
TUVOK: I believe you can help it. Vulcan children learn to detach themselves from their emotions at an early age.#
TUVOK: First, you must focus on the object of your fear. Picture the Morrok clearly in your minds. That image is accompanied by an emotional response. Describe for me what that feeling is like.#
TUVOK: Now, if you could see this emotion in physical form, what would it look like?#
TUVOK: Then imagine a strong wind is pushing that cloud away. Watch as your fear grows more distant. It is no longer a part of you. Once you begin to detach yourselves from your emotional responses, you come closer to controlling them. Eventually, they will be eliminated altogether.#
TUVOK: More accurately, we strive to control our feelings.#
TUVOK: No.#
TUVOK: That is correct.#
TUVOK: The circumstances are irrelevant. A Vulcan approaches every situation logically. Now I must begin work on my shuttle. We will resume the search for the other children once the sensors are operational. I expect each of you to sit quietly and not touch any of the equipment.#
TUVOK: Elani, please put that down.#
TUVOK: Be careful with that! You will stay here and you will stay here.#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: All Vulcans have similarly shaped ears.#
TUVOK: It is the result of many millennia of evolution.#
TUVOK: No.#
TUVOK: My homeworld is on the other side of the galaxy. Elani. Elani! I asked you not to play with that.#
TUVOK: It helps prepare you to attain a meditative state. Now, close your eyes and imagine all the energy in your body is flowing to the point where your fingertips meet. Nothing else you hear or feel is important. Let the outside world fade away. You exist only inside your mind.#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: I have four children. Now you must concentrate.#
TUVOK: Well behaved. They had already mastered several states of heightened awareness by the time they were your age.#
TUVOK: My attachment to my children cannot be described as an emotion. They are part of my identity, and I am incomplete without them.#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: You may.#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: I believe so.#
TUVOK: The sensors are only partially functional. I'm attempting to identify the ship by its shield harmonics.#
TUVOK: It is not a shuttle from Voyager. The pattern of the harmonics matches that of the ships we scanned in orbit around Drayan. It seems your people have come looking for you.#
TUVOK: I don't understand. I thought you wanted to go home.#
TUVOK: For what purpose?#
TUVOK: Why would your own people want to harm you?#
TUVOK: Two of them are coming this way.#
TUVOK: This will hide us from their scanners.#
TUVOK: Why do you believe they've come to kill you?#
TUVOK: It is illogical for a society to kill its own children.#
TUVOK: Vulcans believe that a person's katra, what some might call a soul, continues to exist after the body dies.#
TUVOK: When I was younger, I accepted it without question. In recent years I have experienced doubts. I do believe there is more in each of us than science has yet explained.#
TUVOK: There is nothing wrong in choosing to live.#
TUVOK: Until I can gain a better understanding of your situation, I believe it would be best to get you safely back to Voyager.#
TUVOK: I don't see how you can be thirsty again after four drinks of water.#
TUVOK: I can go several days without rest if necessary. You cannot. It's warmer by the fire. Go back and try to sleep. Do not worry. I have run several thorough scans of the area. There are no other life forms present, inside the cave or anywhere within five kilometres.#
TUVOK: I am also keeping watch on all of you from here. If there is any indication of trouble I will come immediately.#
TUVOK: Apparently not.#
TUVOK: I added more wood less than a half an hour ago. However, it might be wise to check it again.#
TUVOK: I never understood the practice in some cultures of describing ferocious creatures in an attempt to lull children to sleep.#
TUVOK: If my children had difficulty sleeping, I would play music for them.#
TUVOK: Unfortunately I don't have my lute.#
TUVOK: It is a five-stringed instrument tuned on a diatonic scale. It can be very soothing. My youngest son was particularly fond of it. He always used to ask me to play Falor's Journey. It is a tale of enlightenment consisting of three hundred forty eight verses. It may not be necessary to include the complete narrative. Falor was a prosperous merchant who went on a journey to gain greater awareness. 'Through storms he crossed the Voroth Sea To reach the clouded shores of Raal Where old T'Para offered truth. He travelled through the windswept hills And crossed the barren Fire Plains To find the silent monks of Kir. Still unfulfilled, he journeyed home Told stories of the lessons learned And gained true wisdom by the giving. (The children fall asleep. Next morning, Tuvok is working inside the shuttle when -)#
TUVOK: Very well, I'll investigate. I'd like you to wait here while I look inside the cave.#
TUVOK: I will take every possible precaution. I believe you can be responsible with this. Aim like this and press here to fire. I'll seal the shuttle's door while I am gone.#
TUVOK: If there is anything in the cave, it may help us determine what has been happening here. It is very important to gather as much as information as possible.#
TUVOK: We often fear what we do not understand. Our best defence is knowledge. You must trust me, Tressa. I will return shortly.#
TUVOK: I will not abandon you. (Tuvok hands the phaser to Tressa, leaves and closes the shuttle hatch. He goes into the cave and finds Corin's clothes and boots, then two more sets. He returns to the shuttle.)#
TUVOK: I realise it may frighten you, but you must hear the truth. Suffice it to say, I did not find the other children, nor do I have any explanation of what happened to them.#
TUVOK: The disappearances have occurred only at night. We will attempt to leave here before the sun sets.#
TUVOK: That would make it difficult for you to assist me with repairs.#
TUVOK: I have determined that a dielectric field should allow us to pass through them. However, you should still be prepared for some turbulence. Initiating pre-launch sequence. Number three thruster is failing, attempting to stabilise.#
TUVOK: I'm attempting an emergency procedure. Please move away from the console.#
TUVOK: I regret that may be a premature conclusion. The process of powering the thrusters has left us with minimal shields and no functional weapons. Voyager will be watching for us. When we clear the atmosphere, we can be transported aboard the ship.#
TUVOK: You may request asylum with the Federation if you wish. Then we'll be able to protect you.#
TUVOK: The Drayan shuttle is hailing us.#
TUVOK: She believes you intend to kill her. Is that true?#
TUVOK: We can resolve this matter aboard Voyager.#
TUVOK: Do what you will.#
TUVOK: We weren't hit. I believe that was a warning.#
TUVOK: All I can tell you is, I will be here with you.#
TUVOK: What she fears most is being kept here against her wishes.#
TUVOK: I will not leave without Tressa. She has asked for my protection and I intend to provide it.#
TUVOK: She has barely begun it.#
TUVOK: Tressa doesn't seem to be ready. Perhaps she needs more time.#
TUVOK: She can offer you better guidance than I.#
TUVOK: I cannot protect you from the natural conclusion of life, nor would I try. Vulcans consider death to be the completion of a journey. There is nothing to fear.#
TUVOK: No, I'll be fine.#
TUVOK: We'll wait here as long as you like.#
TUVOK: You will still be with them, in their thoughts. As you will be in mine.#
TUVOK: Indications are that any attempt at an evacuation would have been prevented by the atmospheric disturbances.#
TUVOK: Approximately four hundred thousand.#
TUVOK: No weapons of any kind, Captain. It is safe to transport the hibernation pods to Voyager, if that is your intent.#
TUVOK: Perhaps it has malfunctioned.#
TUVOK: They know the system. Why don't we ask them how to proceed?#
TUVOK: We already have a means of communication. The two unoccupied pods.#
TUVOK: Someone is terminating the recall command from inside the system. [Fantasy land] (It is Kim.)#
TUVOK: Fear is the most primitive, the most primordial of biological responses.#
TUVOK: Captain, the longer we allow this to continue, the more likely it is that he will take his frustrations out on the hostages.#
TUVOK: Then perhaps he had another reason for saying it.#
TUVOK: As you well know by now, Mister Neelix, I do not experience exhilaration.#
TUVOK: The weather is certainly adequate for our purposes.#
TUVOK: I am who I am, Mister Neelix. It is impossible for me to be more or less like myself.#
TUVOK: I'm afraid I don't.#
TUVOK: I appreciate nature, yes.#
TUVOK: We are not here to have fun. We are here to collect samples.#
TUVOK: That lovely tune is a traditional funeral dirge.#
TUVOK: Mister Neelix.#
TUVOK: Do you think you could possibly behave a little less like yourself?#
TUVOK: Greetings, Captain.#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: I understand. [Planet surface]#
TUVOK: Those were Captain Janeway's express orders.#
TUVOK: To what end?#
TUVOK: Not if, Mister Neelix. When we leave them behind. The decision has been made. We will of course, provide them with everything they'll need for their survival and comfort. I am arranging for a modular shelter to be transported to the surface. They'll have all the technology they need. Weapons, tricorders, a replicator.#
TUVOK: That is not a certainty. Captain Janeway intends to continue researching the virus. She is an able scientist, and may eventually be able to effect a cure. They have a type nine shuttlecraft at their disposal if it becomes possible for them to leave the planet.#
TUVOK: I'm not certain what it is you expect me to do, Lieutenant.#
TUVOK: You are correct that I am unable to experience that emotion. And frankly, I fail to see what the benefit would be. If there is nothing more, you are all dismissed. [Ready room] JANEWAY#
TUVOK: Yes, Captain.#
TUVOK: I will remain in orbit until I hear from you. And after that, we can still remain in communication for approximately thirty six hours.#
TUVOK: Yes, Ensign?#
TUVOK: Distance?#
TUVOK: Lieutenant, alter course to a different heading. I don't want to risk their detecting us.#
TUVOK: Yes?#
TUVOK: You're aware that Captain Janeway specifically told us not to risk contacting the Vidiians.#
TUVOK: That bit of sophistry is not terribly persuasive, Ensign.#
TUVOK: The matter is closed, Ensign. Return to your station.#
TUVOK: Ensign Kim.#
TUVOK: Ensign, you are relieved of duty. Leave the Bridge at once or I will have you put in the brig.#
TUVOK: Proceed on the altered course, Lieutenant. [Mess hall]#
TUVOK: It's zero one hundred hours, Ensign. Don't you have the early shift this morning?#
TUVOK: Very well.#
TUVOK: Apology accepted. I understand that this is a difficult situation for you.#
TUVOK: Those are, as you say, points in our favour. But there is also the fact that we were recently responsible for the destruction of a Vidiian ship, an act which killed over three hundred of their people. That alone makes it unwise for us to contact them.#
TUVOK: The people you talk to do not have the responsibility of commanding this vessel. I do. The safety of this crew is paramount, and I must do whatever I can to ensure that safety.#
TUVOK: Ensign, I'm going to say this once and once only. If you ever question my orders again, you will be relieved of duty permanently. The next words I expect to hear from you are yes sir.#
TUVOK: Of course. Please sit down.#
TUVOK: Your father?#
TUVOK: Then we owe him a debt. It is difficult to imagine this journey without you.#
TUVOK: I am honoured by the comparison.#
TUVOK: Of course.#
TUVOK: I cannot allow myself to become hostage to their feelings.#
TUVOK: If you are suggesting that I am not sensitive to the situation, nothing could be further from the truth. I have lost a valued friend. I am not immune to the effects of that loss.#
TUVOK: On screen.#
TUVOK: Dr. Pel. I didn't expect to see you this quickly.#
TUVOK: They were infected by a virus after being bitten by insects on a planet approximately seventy light years from here, in a system with a yellow dwarf star.#
TUVOK: Yes.#
TUVOK: Can we get some from you?#
TUVOK: Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate your help.#
TUVOK: Estimated time to the coordinates?#
TUVOK: Until then, I want a series of battle drills. We must be ready for whatever comes. [Outside the shelter] (Tidying up.)#
TUVOK: Hail them.#
TUVOK: Red alert.#
TUVOK: Rearm the forward phaser array and fire at will.#
TUVOK: Load aft torpedo bays.#
TUVOK: Fire number one. Report.#
TUVOK: Fire number two. Tuvok to Engineering.#
TUVOK: Keep this comm. line open, Doctor. When you hear me order the shields down, you must complete a site-to-site transport yourself. We will be busy with the Vidiians.#
TUVOK: Bridge to Engineering.#
TUVOK: Report.#
TUVOK: Set a course for the planet where we left the Captain and Commander Chakotay. Warp six.#
TUVOK: I disobeyed your order, Captain. I am prepared to accept the consequences.#
TUVOK: You have confirmed the genetic structure?#
TUVOK: That is an honour you should reserve for yourself, Mister Suder. You gave this species life.#
TUVOK: The meld may have introduced you to my interest in floriculture, but you have embraced it entirely on your own, and discovered a unique talent within yourself in the process.#
TUVOK: Very well. I accept.#
TUVOK: What contribution do you feel you could make from your quarters?#
TUVOK: Your attitude is admirable. I will discuss it with the Captain.#
TUVOK: We'll see. Now, shall we begin? Notice your mind working, how it plans for the future, visits the past. Notice those thoughts and set them aside. Turn your attention to the white light that is your breath.#
TUVOK: I recommend a full diagnostic of our tactical array prior to the start of the mission, Captain.#
TUVOK: But can they? If the Kazon scan the holograms, they will immediately realise there are no life signs on board, no power signatures.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: Computer, display tactical overview of our current course.#
TUVOK: A small raider, Captain. It does not pose a significant threat. Nevertheless, it is powering up its weapon systems.#
TUVOK: The raider is breaking off its attack.#
TUVOK: Captain.#
TUVOK: The Captain's time is limited, Mister Suder.#
TUVOK: I have explained your proposal to her.#
TUVOK: Mister Suder.#
TUVOK: Acknowledged. They're withdrawing, Captain.#
TUVOK: Acknowledged. [Suder's quarters]#
TUVOK: Eight large carrier vessels, confirmed Kazon signatures.#
TUVOK: Curious. They have left us with an obvious avenue of escape, Captain.#
TUVOK: Four of the Kazon ships are breaking formation.#
TUVOK: They are randomly detonating torpedoes in our flight path.#
TUVOK: Kazon vessel ten thousand kilometres off our starboard bow.#
TUVOK: Six thousand kilometres.#
TUVOK: Five thousand, three, two thousand.#
TUVOK: Two more Kazon ships approaching.#
TUVOK: Torpedoes loaded.#
TUVOK: Damage control teams to deck eight.#
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.#
TUVOK: We've lost power to forward phasers.#
TUVOK: We're being boarded through the shuttle bays, Captain. Phaser fights reported on decks five, six, seven.#
TUVOK: Beta team, this way.#
TUVOK: I have already begun to design some rudimentary devices, Captain.#
TUVOK: I've completed a few weapons that might be appropriate, Commander.#
TUVOK: This is mine. I taught archery science for several years at the Vulcan Institute of Defensive Arts.#
TUVOK: From a tactical point of view, the options are not encouraging. However, moving past the creature might lead us to an exit.#
TUVOK: Nevertheless#
TUVOK: You may find nobility in the savage, Commander, but he is only interested in killing you.#
TUVOK: I offer you a Vulcan prayer, Mister Suder. May your death bring you the peace you never found in life. (Chakotay is by Seska's body on another biobed. He draws the sheet over her face.)#
TUVOK: It is standard procedure to carry arms on an away mission, particularly when you don't know what to expect.#
TUVOK: Doctor, is there anything that might be preventing her from using the homing signal in her implant?#
TUVOK: Is she delusional?#
TUVOK: Commander, the decision is ultimately yours, of course. However, I believe it would be the Captain's desire to complete the ritual.#
TUVOK: I am picking up an M-class atmosphere on the second planet, humanoid life signs. However, metallurgic analysis indicates a pre-industrial civilisation, a Bronze Age level of technology. Curious, Captain.#
TUVOK: I'm detecting evidence that these people have had contact with the Alpha Quadrant.#
TUVOK: It is a modulated energy discharge that appears to be consistent with the recent use of a replicator.#
TUVOK: According to Starfleet computer records, approximately seven years ago, the Federation Starship Enterprise hosted negotiations for ownership of the  Barzan wormhole. Included among the bidding parties were two Ferengi, minor functionaries known as Arridor and Kol.#
TUVOK: But the Ferengi were not aware of that, and during a nefarious attempt to secure the wormhole for themselves, they were pulled into it and deposited in the Delta Quadrant.#
TUVOK: Captain, I must remind you that the Ferengi are not members of the Federation. They are not bound by the Prime Directive. Nor would it seem that the Prime Directive would allow us to interfere with the internal affairs of this society, as much as we may disapprove of what the Ferengi are doing.#
TUVOK: That is a most logical interpretation, Captain.#
TUVOK: We have been bombarding a local subspace instability with verteron particles. If all goes according to plan, the Barzan wormhole should reopen at out present location in a matter of hours.#
TUVOK: Then we must find a way to make it more profitable for them to leave.#
TUVOK: Captain, I am still unable to penetrate the Ferengi dampening field. If the away team experiences difficulties, we will be unable to beam them out.#
TUVOK: Shield are optimal.#
TUVOK: Go ahead, Doctor.#
TUVOK: Captain, security has been breached in the shuttle bay.#
TUVOK: The Ferengi have phasered the shuttle bay door. They are exiting the ship.#
TUVOK: The Ferengi are hailing us, Captain.#
TUVOK: Captain, a gravitational eddy from the wormhole is attracting the Ferengi shuttle. They're being pulled in. [Ferengi shuttle]#
