CHAKOTAY:  Damage report.#
CHAKOTAY: Be creative!#
CHAKOTAY: Initiating evasive pattern omega. Mark.#
CHAKOTAY: I need more power if we're going to make it to the Badlands.#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, shut down all the phaser banks. If you can give me another thirty seconds at full impulse, I'll get us into the Badlands.#
CHAKOTAY: Throw the last photons at them and then give me the power from the torpedo system.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you reading any plasma storms ahead?#
CHAKOTAY: That's where I'm going.#
CHAKOTAY: Hold on!#
CHAKOTAY: Gul Evek must feel daring today.#
CHAKOTAY: Can you plot a course through these plasma fields, Mister Tuvok?#
CHAKOTAY: We can use a time to make some repairs. What was that?#
CHAKOTAY: Source?#
CHAKOTAY: Another storm?#
CHAKOTAY: Anything left in those impulse generators, B'Elanna?#
CHAKOTAY: Maximum power.#
CHAKOTAY: Were you going to deliver us into their waiting hands, Vulcan?#
CHAKOTAY: I see you had help.#
CHAKOTAY: At least the Vulcan was doing his duty as a Starfleet officer. But you, you betrayed us for what? Freedom from prison? Latinum? What was your price this time?#
CHAKOTAY: He can tell us where they are.#
CHAKOTAY: Where are our people?#
CHAKOTAY: We won't do that.#
CHAKOTAY: The Ocampa use it for barter?#
CHAKOTAY: But she got out.#
CHAKOTAY: Maybe you can't, but we can.#
CHAKOTAY: If the array is the Ocampa's sole source of energy, why would the Caretaker seal the conduits?#
CHAKOTAY: That doesn't necessarily mean he's dying. He could be leaving.#
CHAKOTAY: My leg is broken. I can't move.#
CHAKOTAY: Get out of here, Paris, before the whole thing comes down!#
CHAKOTAY: You get on those stairs, they'll collapse! We'll both die!#
CHAKOTAY: Wrong tribe.#
CHAKOTAY: Fine. Be a fool. If I have to die, at least I'll have the pleasure of watching you go with me. (With Chakotay's arms around his neck, Paris pulls them both up the remaining steps.)#
CHAKOTAY: You're too heavy.#
CHAKOTAY: We've got to get back to our ship.#
CHAKOTAY: I think so, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Their weapons array has been hit. They're in trouble.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm setting a collision course, but the guidance system is disabled. I'll have to pilot the ship manually. Get the crew ready to beam to Voyager. And drop shields for transport. Paris, my crew's coming over. Tell one of your crackerjack Starfleet transporter chiefs to keep a lock on me. I'm going to try and take some heat off your tail.#
CHAKOTAY: Wait.#
CHAKOTAY: Now!#
CHAKOTAY: They've got me.#
CHAKOTAY: She's the Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Then what happened?#
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, Lieutenant. I'll take care of this.#
CHAKOTAY: I've confined her to quarters.#
CHAKOTAY: Formal charges? Come on, Tuvok. We're seventy five years away from the nearest court. Are you really going to hold her in the brig for that long?#
CHAKOTAY: Well, I'd like to settle this on my own without filing charges and without involving the Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: She's a Maquis, and in the Maquis, sometimes you have to push people out of your way to get things done.#
CHAKOTAY: Look, Lieutenant, I don't have to explain myself to you. I'll deal with B'Elanna personally, and then I'll inform the Captain. You're to drop this matter. That's an order.#
CHAKOTAY: You do that. (The doors close and Tuvok walks away. Chakotay gets out on another floor and is joined by two of his Maquis crew.)#
CHAKOTAY: I don't know yet but I'll handle it.#
CHAKOTAY: Not true.#
CHAKOTAY: What does that mean?#
CHAKOTAY: If I ever hear you talk that way again, I'll personally throw you in the brig for mutiny.#
CHAKOTAY: Here.#
CHAKOTAY: The medical report on Lieutenant Carey.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't want to hear it! You might be interested to know that the impact fractures along his cranium were pretty severe. If you'd hit him just a little harder, you could have driven some of those bones into his cerebellum.#
CHAKOTAY: So on the one side, I'm facing a Vulcan who wants court-martial you. And on the other, I'm facing all the Maquis who are ready to seize this ship over this. You've turned this into one lousy day for me, Torres.#
CHAKOTAY: Rest of the trip. Seventy five years.#
CHAKOTAY: Or I could send you back to work with the understanding that you'll apologise to#
CHAKOTAY: Not just a simple apology. A personal one, over a hot cup of pejuta. Bond with the man.#
CHAKOTAY: You're going to need support from people like Carey.#
CHAKOTAY: You are if you're going to be Chief Engineer of this ship.#
CHAKOTAY: This is not another example of my twisted sense of humour.#
CHAKOTAY: You're a better engineer than he is.#
CHAKOTAY: She hasn't said a word, because I haven't told her yet. Captain's log, Stardate 48439.7. As we maintain a course back to the Alpha Quadrant, we're conducting what would normally be routine maintenance to the ship. Routine, that is, if we had access to a starbase.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if we relocate all security personnel to deck seven, we can shut down power on deck nine and reroute it to propulsion.#
CHAKOTAY: I've made a list of several Maquis crew members who would make good officers.#
CHAKOTAY: That's right.#
CHAKOTAY: Chief Engineer.#
CHAKOTAY: Very.#
CHAKOTAY: Perhaps we should assign somebody to train with the hologram as a field medic.#
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Torres. We need a way to get that ship out of there. Any ideas?#
CHAKOTAY: A subspace tractor beam?#
CHAKOTAY: When can you have it ready?#
CHAKOTAY: Get right on it. Use as many people as you need.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I appreciate your concerns about Torres, but I promise you#
CHAKOTAY: Me?#
CHAKOTAY: In what way?#
CHAKOTAY: I've worked with her. I know what she's capable of. We needed an answer right away and I knew she could give us one.#
CHAKOTAY: If you look at it that way, none of my people will ever have seniority.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm doing everything I can to integrate them into your crew, but frankly, you're not making it easy for me, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: But some of them, like B'Elanna Torres have the ability.#
CHAKOTAY: You're asking them to accept me.#
CHAKOTAY: Permission to speak freely.#
CHAKOTAY: I have no intention of being your token Maquis officer.#
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna Torres.#
CHAKOTAY: She's the best engineer I've ever known. She could teach at the Academy. You're right, Captain. I do consider these my people because nobody else on this ship will look out for them like I will. And I'm telling you, you're going to have to give them more authority if you want their loyalty.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm trying to help you. I'm sorry you don't see that. I strongly recommend you get to know Torres before you choose a new Chief Engineer. Permission to leave.#
CHAKOTAY: What's going on?#
CHAKOTAY: Are we abandoning the rescue attempt?#
CHAKOTAY: It looks like we're running into more spatial distortions.#
CHAKOTAY: Who will represent Engineering?#
CHAKOTAY: You should invite B'Elanna Torres as well, unless you've removed her from consideration.#
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, do you think you can work with Mister Carey to clean up that signal?#
CHAKOTAY: That's your hail.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying we're the ones trapped in the singularity?#
CHAKOTAY: Hold our position! Mister Tuvok, report.#
CHAKOTAY: Mister Paris, as soon as we've recovered the shuttlecraft, lay in a course toward the rupture and take us out.#
CHAKOTAY: We're almost to the rupture. Mister Paris is about to impress us with his piloting skills.#
CHAKOTAY: There they are. Your staff.#
CHAKOTAY: First order of the day. The Captain wants the warp drive back online by thirteen hours.#
CHAKOTAY: Then maybe you need to go break a few noses, or at least bend a few. Lieutenant.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you checking up on your new Chief Engineer?#
CHAKOTAY: And?#
CHAKOTAY: Can I ask you a question, off the record? If things had happened differently, and we were on the Maquis ship now instead of Voyager, would you have served under me?#
CHAKOTAY: Density patterns on the surface show artificial waterways and a global aqueduct system. There is a civilisation down there, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: So it's possible that the Captain and Paris are existing only hours and minutes before the explosion occurs.#
CHAKOTAY: How do we find them?#
CHAKOTAY: Wide enough for the Captain and Paris to get through?#
CHAKOTAY: Can't we re-initialise the generator and start again?#
CHAKOTAY: How do we prevent one of us getting trapped in a fracture?#
CHAKOTAY: Nice work.#
CHAKOTAY: We're getting ready to leave right now.#
CHAKOTAY: There's nothing down there you want to see, Kes.#
CHAKOTAY: What is it?#
CHAKOTAY: I know. It's like walking through a graveyard.#
CHAKOTAY: What have you found?#
CHAKOTAY: The subspace beacon?#
CHAKOTAY: Can we locate the source of the signal?#
CHAKOTAY: Is there a subspace fracture anywhere in here?#
CHAKOTAY: Set up the equipment.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Janeway.#
CHAKOTAY: If it were me, I would have tried to get there.#
CHAKOTAY: You think you can locate the flash-point?#
CHAKOTAY: Let's go. [Outside the Power Plant]#
CHAKOTAY: Do we have subspace fractures to work with here?#
CHAKOTAY: Set up the equipment.#
CHAKOTAY: If Kes is right, the Captain was here at the moment the explosion occurred. Is there anyway to break through subspace a few minutes before the detonation?#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Captain Janeway.#
CHAKOTAY: We've identified an M-class planet in the red dwarf system we're approaching. Do you want to change course to investigate?#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant Torres has already asked permission to start modifications to the auxiliary impulse reactor. It could be converted into a crude dilithium refinery.#
CHAKOTAY: Her arguments are quite convincing. She thinks it can be done safely.#
CHAKOTAY: Ah.#
CHAKOTAY: Mmm. Sounds delicious, but I've already had my vacuum-packed oatmeal this morning.#
CHAKOTAY: Class M. It'll make mining a lot easier if we can go in there without environmental suits.#
CHAKOTAY: Ensign Kim.#
CHAKOTAY: Where are you going?#
CHAKOTAY: It looks like there are several large deposits in this general vicinity. Let's split up and begin taking geological scans. Keep your comm. channels open at all times and don't wander too far. Stay within a fifty metre radius of this position. (The three take different tunnels. They don't notice their beam in site transform into a constructed tunnel with pipes along the wall, and a humanoid step into it.) CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kim.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm still picking up dilithium signatures but there are no dilithium formations here. Have you found anything yet? [Tunnel 2]#
CHAKOTAY: Neelix. Stay within the search radius. I'll be with you in a minute.#
CHAKOTAY: All right, I've had enough#
CHAKOTAY: Of this. Kim, Neelix, we're heading back to the ship.#
CHAKOTAY: Neelix, what's wrong? Neelix! Kim! [Tunnel 2]#
CHAKOTAY: I can't be certain, but I think he's going into shock. Chakotay to Voyager, medical emergency. Beam us directly to sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: The what?#
CHAKOTAY: By the time we got to him he was unconscious.#
CHAKOTAY: The Doctor says whoever did this used some kind of transporter to beam the lungs directly out of his body.#
CHAKOTAY: No.#
CHAKOTAY: Up an alien ship leaving the planet.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain! The alien ship has dropped out of warp. It's approaching a large asteroid.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying some one built this asteroid?#
CHAKOTAY: Let's see it.#
CHAKOTAY: Are there any indications we're being scanned or probed, Mister Kim?#
CHAKOTAY: What the hell?#
CHAKOTAY: He might have left a fake ion trail to lure us in here. It could lead us right into one of those walls.#
CHAKOTAY: Well, maybe we should. Tuvok, what would happen if we reduced the phaser power level to a minimum setting and sent out a continuous beam.#
CHAKOTAY: Until it encountered a non-reflective material, like the real alien ship.#
CHAKOTAY: Exactly.#
CHAKOTAY: There was no need for you to come to the bridge, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: I just wanted to alert you to a nebula we've picked up on long range sensors.#
CHAKOTAY: No way to go but up.#
CHAKOTAY: There's a nuanka, a period of mourning, that everyone's going through. It's a natural reaction.#
CHAKOTAY: We talk to animals. It's a Native American tradition.#
CHAKOTAY: Our own counsellors. We're taught that an animal guide accompanies us through life. Basically, it's what Carl Jung thought he invented when he came up with his active imagination technique in 1932, but we've been doing pretty much the same thing for centuries.#
CHAKOTAY: Actually, yes.#
CHAKOTAY: Why do you say that?#
CHAKOTAY: Thank you. The bear is a very powerful animal. It has great pokattah. But he's not my animal guide. The creature that guides us doesn't define who we are. It merely chooses to be with us.#
CHAKOTAY: I can't tell you that. It would offend my animal guide if I spoke its name.#
CHAKOTAY: Actually, it's a female. But yes, she usually guides me very well.#
CHAKOTAY: It's not quite that simple.#
CHAKOTAY: If you're interested, I'll be glad to teach you how to contact your animal guide.#
CHAKOTAY: Whatever they are, they're passing right through our shields.#
CHAKOTAY: Reversing shield polarity hasn't had any effect.#
CHAKOTAY: We have a complement of thirty eight photon torpedoes at our disposal, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Ready a photon.#
CHAKOTAY: Repair crews have degaussed the hull, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: My medicine bundle. I've never showed it to anyone before. After what you said this morning, I thought it was important to let you see.#
CHAKOTAY: Eventually you'll have to assemble your own medicine bundle, but this will allow me to assist you in your quest for a guide.#
CHAKOTAY: A blackbird's wing. A stone from the river. An akoonah.#
CHAKOTAY: My ancestors used psychoactive herbs to assist their vision quests. Now they're no longer necessary. Our scientists have found more modern ways to facilitate the search for animal guides. Place your hand on it and concentrate on the stone. A-koo-chee-moy-a. We are far from the sacred places of our grandfathers. We are far from the bones of our people. But perhaps there is one powerful being who will embrace this woman and give her the answers she seeks. Allow your eyes to close. Breath to fuel the light in your belly, and let it expand until the light is everywhere. Prepare yourself to leave this room and this ship, and return to a place where you were the most content and peaceful you have ever been. You can see all around you and hear the sounds of this place. {Beach] (A seabird calls.)#
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna's the only one I know who tried to kill her animal guide.#
CHAKOTAY: The way the barrier was protecting the omicron particles almost suggests we were entering a vital organ.#
CHAKOTAY: We're very busy up here, Neelix. What do you need?#
CHAKOTAY: We found out that the nebula is actually a life form and we've got to go back in to repair some damage we did to it. Chakotay out. [Mess Hall]#
CHAKOTAY: I believe the optical data network is down, Ensign.#
CHAKOTAY: It seems to be leaving us alone now that we've cut off all propulsion systems. Maybe that's what cues it to respond. If I'm right, we might be able to get back without engaging any engines.#
CHAKOTAY: We've been reading these swirling energy currents since we first got here. When we thought it was a nebula, we weren't looking for any pattern. We thought they were just random eddies. But now I'm wondering if these currents might be some kind of circulatory system.#
CHAKOTAY: The life form's regeneration rate is up forty percent, Captain. Looks like it's well on the way to closing that wound.#
CHAKOTAY: It's called a cue, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: But is it stable enough for us to enter, and if it is, where does it lead?#
CHAKOTAY: If that's a wormhole, it must be the smallest one on record.#
CHAKOTAY: Any idea yet where that message would end up, Ensign?#
CHAKOTAY: I'm reading transmission of the test signal. The probe has received it and relayed it.#
CHAKOTAY: Even if someone receives our signal, it might take them some time to figure out how to return it.#
CHAKOTAY: Why would he have broken off transmission?#
CHAKOTAY: If he's engaged in some kind of secret research he might want to conceal that fact.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. [Doctor's office]#
CHAKOTAY: With pleasure, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: If it's successful, we'd like to try transmitting a test cylinder to you.#
CHAKOTAY: Energise. [Transporter Room]#
CHAKOTAY: Kim and Torres have made more than twenty transports of the test cylinder, even though she's still having trouble with that phase variance. Every one of them has been successful.#
CHAKOTAY: But this is 2371.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid that's not possible either. We've already had a huge impact on this quadrant. People and events here would be drastically affected.#
CHAKOTAY: We're scanning a Numiri vessel approaching. They're at combat readiness, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Evasive pattern confirmed.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if you don't mind, there's a Maquis trick we sometimes used to get out of situations like this.#
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna. Remember Teluridian Four? The two Starfleet runabouts?#
CHAKOTAY: Cut all engines.#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, lock phasers on their navigational deflectors.#
CHAKOTAY: It worked against those Starfleet runabouts.#
CHAKOTAY: Besides, out here in the Delta quadrant, every old trick is new again.#
CHAKOTAY: That's our cue. Fire phasers. Engage impulse engines.#
CHAKOTAY: I have more.#
CHAKOTAY: Yourself?#
CHAKOTAY: They're going straight for the shuttle, just as you said they would, Lieutenant.#
CHAKOTAY: The shuttle's being released. The Numiri ship is withdrawing.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. Mister Kim, would you like to join us?#
CHAKOTAY: I'm picking up a large cavern in there. The readings are#
CHAKOTAY: What the hell is this?#
CHAKOTAY: I want to see what's ahead.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, there are eighteen bodies here, all humanoid. Eleven male, seven female. From what we can tell they're in various stages of decomposition. Some have been here for years.#
CHAKOTAY: But from the position of the arms, I'd say we're looking at some kind of burial site.#
CHAKOTAY: However, Mister Kim has a different opinion.#
CHAKOTAY: But whatever belief this race has, they clearly meant for their dead to be left alone and I think we should respect that.#
CHAKOTAY: The sanctity of these bodies should be respected. I recommend we make visual observations only. No tricorders.#
CHAKOTAY: All right. The only sensors you have left are your eyes. Concentrate on details. We're going to have to do a thorough report when we get back.#
CHAKOTAY: I remember the first time I went on a tomb excavation on Ktaria Seven. I wanted to keep a memento of the experience, so I picked up a rock from the burial site. Only I found out later it wasn't just a rock.#
CHAKOTAY: It was a sacred stone. The Ktarians lay thousands of them in the tomb. Each one represents a special prayer. Without realising it, I had desecrated that man's grave.#
CHAKOTAY: Really? What have you learned about this culture so far?#
CHAKOTAY: You're looking but you're not seeing. The fact that they're naked says a lot. It means this race doesn't believe in dressing the deceased. And the lack of artefacts could indicate they don't believe any worldly goods can be taken into the afterlife.#
CHAKOTAY: Look at the position of the arms and hands. The bodies have been arranged in poses of serenity, and they appear to be wrapped in the same biopolymer residue we found out in the passageway, all indications that this culture has a great deal of ritual associated with disposing of the dead. That normally indicates some belief in the afterlife.#
CHAKOTAY: Good point. However, some archaeological digs on the Klingon Homeworld#
CHAKOTAY: Tricorders!#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager. Emergency beam-out.#
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Energise!#
CHAKOTAY: This body might have come out of the vacuole at the same time Kim was taken in.#
CHAKOTAY: We can't interfere with this woman's natural process of death.#
CHAKOTAY: Beam us directly to Sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: So the other biopolymer fibres we found in the cavern were#
CHAKOTAY: We've completed our analysis of the ring system. Our sensors have detected over two hundred thousand alien bodies on various asteroids in the rings. From what we can tell, a subspace vacuole appears about every two hours, deposits a body and then disappears.#
CHAKOTAY: We could send Ptera through the subspace transponder and hope the signal will penetrate the dimensional barrier and allow us to lock on to Kim with the transporter beam.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. Captain's log, supplemental. We've returned to the ring system, and we're preparing to send Ptera back to her dimension. Lieutenant Torres has found a way to temporarily protect the warp core against the vacuoles but she is uncertain how long her measures will be effective. [Transporter room]#
CHAKOTAY: Okay, let's see if your dampening field is going to protect the warp core.#
CHAKOTAY: Engineering to Transporter Room three. [Transporter room]#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Transporter Room Three. Lock onto the body on deck fifteen and transport it to one of the asteroids.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I'm picking up a vacuole forming on deck twelve. It deposited a human body.#
CHAKOTAY: But it's dead.#
CHAKOTAY: The subspace distress signal is coming from a vessel bearing one two five mark two one. Distance two hundred thousand kilometres.#
CHAKOTAY: And the possibility exists that we could reconfigure the matrix at that point to take us another thirty thousand light years, right into Federation space.#
CHAKOTAY: I know of many times when Starfleet personnel have decided on strong ethical grounds to ignore it.#
CHAKOTAY: Maybe they want something. Maybe they'll bargain.#
CHAKOTAY: What do you think, Captain? Would they be interested?#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, it'll take hours to get everyone up. We've got crewmembers scattered throughout both hemispheres.#
CHAKOTAY: Mister Tuvok is on the surface now, Captain. He says the remaining away teams should be on board in fifteen minutes.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. As soon as the last of the crew gets back, we'll be ready to leave.#
CHAKOTAY: I think we get the picture.#
CHAKOTAY: What is it?#
CHAKOTAY: You expect us to eat this?#
CHAKOTAY: I'd find the second best source acceptable if it tasted better.#
CHAKOTAY: Nothing but bloodworms. Neelix wants to bring some back for a tartar#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay out. All units, report to transport site A immediately.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain. Transporter Room, get ready to begin on my command.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Seska. Transporter room, can you locate Ensign Seska's comm. badge signal?#
CHAKOTAY: If she went inside one, it might be blocking her comm. badge signal. The rest of you get back to the ship. I'm going to look for her.#
CHAKOTAY: What are you doing here?#
CHAKOTAY: I appreciate the thought, but we've got to get out of here. (Kazons start shooting at them. Chakotay is hit. Seska deals with their attackers then helps Chakotay out of the cave.) Captain's log, stardate 48658.2. We successfully left orbit without further interference from the Kazon. Commander Chakotay was injured, but is recovering from his wounds. [Chakotay's quarters] CHAKOTAY: Come in.#
CHAKOTAY: Yeah. What have you got there?#
CHAKOTAY: You got Neelix to make some mushroom soup!#
CHAKOTAY: So how did you?#
CHAKOTAY: Mm hmm.#
CHAKOTAY: You looted the food reserves?#
CHAKOTAY: I can't believe you did this.#
CHAKOTAY: Thanks for including me in a criminal conspiracy. Does he know about this yet?#
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead, Neelix.#
CHAKOTAY: I know.#
CHAKOTAY: I promise you, everyone involved will be disciplined.#
CHAKOTAY: Thank you. I'll handle that. Chakotay out. Replicator privileges revoked for two days. Everyone, including me.#
CHAKOTAY: Then I'll personally put them in the brig.#
CHAKOTAY: That's not the point.#
CHAKOTAY: No one, but we agreed a long time ago this wouldn't work.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm showing high levels of nucleonic radiation. It seems to be isolated in that area.#
CHAKOTAY: Away team to Voyager. We've got a single male Kazon alive on the bridge. Transport him directly to Sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: The crew members closest to the explosion were virtually melded with huge pieces of metal fragments. He was luckier than the others.#
CHAKOTAY: It looked like they were trying to install some new technology that detonated.#
CHAKOTAY: A console on the bridge was the source of the explosion. We're not sure what its function was, and it's going to be hard to get to.#
CHAKOTAY: Not with those levels of nucleonic radiation. The transporter beam would disperse the moment it hit the irradiated cabin.#
CHAKOTAY: Were there any other reports of missing starships?#
CHAKOTAY: A dozen people. We were scattered all over the area.#
CHAKOTAY: Seska almost killed me because she thought I was Kazon. She wouldn't do something like this.#
CHAKOTAY: No. I want Ensign Seska to coordinate the operation from our bridge.#
CHAKOTAY: What?#
CHAKOTAY: I disagree. We need someone up there who#
CHAKOTAY: There's some concern about you.#
CHAKOTAY: Concern because I found you near the Kazon on the planet.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't believe that.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm trying to take you out of harm's way to protect you.#
CHAKOTAY: You don't assign someone you don't trust to the Bridge. Look, I'm sorry, but if something goes wrong over there, I don't want you anywhere near it.#
CHAKOTAY: And whoever it was, was an expert at covering their tracks.#
CHAKOTAY: Only the whole engineering crew.#
CHAKOTAY: It's like working backwards through a maze of circuits. We keep bumping into dead ends.#
CHAKOTAY: What the hell do you think you're doing?#
CHAKOTAY: I want you back on this ship, and I mean now. [Kazon ship]#
CHAKOTAY: She's gone back to the Kazon ship to prove herself to us. Can't you see that?#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Seska. Seska, respond! Get her out of there! Send her to Sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: How have things been going for you in Engineering?#
CHAKOTAY: You getting along all right with Lieutenant Torres?#
CHAKOTAY: You were out of contact for almost an hour on the planet where we encountered the Kazon.#
CHAKOTAY: Did you see anyone else at your station?#
CHAKOTAY: He had the motive and the opportunity.#
CHAKOTAY: So have I.#
CHAKOTAY: You're making me to believe she's a Cardassian agent who infiltrated the Maquis?#
CHAKOTAY: This is crazy. This is just impossible.#
CHAKOTAY: If you don't mind, I'd like to hear her explanation before we dismiss it. Has she been told?#
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to be the one who questions her.#
CHAKOTAY: You were working for her. Seska was working for them. Was anyone on board that ship working for me?#
CHAKOTAY: We've recovered the console. It's a replicator, constructed with materials from Voyager.#
CHAKOTAY: Did you?#
CHAKOTAY: To be honest, I'm not sure anymore. I'm not sure of a lot of things.#
CHAKOTAY: I plan to.#
CHAKOTAY: You know, it's funny. I've been thinking about what's been real and what's not been real.#
CHAKOTAY: What would you say I owe to a Cardassian who infiltrated my crew?#
CHAKOTAY: Isn't that why you never got around to a blood analysis when we came on board?#
CHAKOTAY: Turns out your blood is missing all the common Bajoran blood factors.#
CHAKOTAY: Orkett's disease.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm starting to wonder.#
CHAKOTAY: I want to.#
CHAKOTAY: Let's not rush things.#
CHAKOTAY: You're going to have to stay confined, at least until we find out exactly where the replicator components were taken from.#
CHAKOTAY: There might be evidence of who took them.#
CHAKOTAY: Chief Inspector Tuvok leaves no stone unturned. I'll tell the Captain what you told me. Somehow we'll try to clear this up soon.#
CHAKOTAY: She said a Cardassian bone marrow transplant saved her life as a child.#
CHAKOTAY: Now all we can do is wait and hope someone takes the bait.#
CHAKOTAY: I never knew Vulcans had such a talent for cards.#
CHAKOTAY: If you ever need a sponsor in a gin tournament, let me know.#
CHAKOTAY: That's sounds like a nibble to me.#
CHAKOTAY: Should we start the trace now?#
CHAKOTAY: Which would suggest they're hiding it. But not very well.#
CHAKOTAY: I do. It's Seska's.#
CHAKOTAY: It's over. We know who gave the technology to the Kazon.#
CHAKOTAY: You did.#
CHAKOTAY: We found the evidence you put there for us to find. Your own security code.#
CHAKOTAY: We already knew where the stolen materials had been taken from before I met with you. We were monitoring the inventory manifest, hoping either you or Carey would try to cover your tracks.#
CHAKOTAY: That's exactly what you did. You knew no one would believe you could be that careless. You wanted us to believe that someone else was trying to frame you.#
CHAKOTAY: We traced the computer station used to enter the data. Oh, you took us all around the system and back again before we could locate the source, but it was this station, in Sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: I'd almost say it was a Maquis operation, if I didn't already know you were a Cardassian. Computer, activate Emergency Holographic Medical Programme.#
CHAKOTAY: Before you even mentioned Orkett's disease to me, the Doctor had already discounted that as a possible explanation for your blood anomalies.#
CHAKOTAY: But that didn't necessarily make you the traitor we were looking for. We needed more evidence, and you gave it to us. The one thing I still can't understand is why?#
CHAKOTAY: Computer, override transport in progress.#
CHAKOTAY: Can I ask you to be honest with me, Lieutenant?#
CHAKOTAY: That's not exactly true. You lied to me when you passed yourself off as a Maquis to get on my crew.#
CHAKOTAY: You damned Vulcans and your defined parameters. That's easy for you.#
CHAKOTAY: I'd just like to know, from someone else who pulled the wool over my eyes, was I particularly naive? Was I not paying enough attention? What the hell was it that let all you spies get by me?#
CHAKOTAY: Did you ever see anything about Seska that make you suspicious?#
CHAKOTAY: Well, that makes me feel a little better. Thanks.#
CHAKOTAY: What?#
CHAKOTAY: Misery loves company, Tuvok.#
CHAKOTAY: His last shift ended four hours ago, and he was scheduled for time on holodeck two when he went off duty. No one has seen him since.#
CHAKOTAY: Can you shut it down?#
CHAKOTAY: All right, let's go in. [Holodeck - Forest] (Night time. Frogs are calling.) CHAKOTAY: Computer, identify programme.#
CHAKOTAY: An ancient English epic, set in sixth century Denmark, if I remember correctly. It's about a hero named Beowulf who fights a creature that's terrorising a kingdom and murdering its subjects. Monsters and swordplay. That sort of thing.#
CHAKOTAY: I can't determine the source.#
CHAKOTAY: The holodeck command systems must not be functioning either.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes. We are Beowulf's kinsmen. My name is Chakotay and this is Tuvok. Have you seen Beowulf?#
CHAKOTAY: This is Harry's holonovel. It'd make sense that he'd be playing the hero. She might be able to help us figure out what happened to him.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes. But first we'd like to know more about how Beowulf died.#
CHAKOTAY: Could you tell us exactly what happened to him?#
CHAKOTAY: That's the monster who's been attacking you.#
CHAKOTAY: Did anyone actually see the battle?#
CHAKOTAY: Then I think we'd like to see this Grendel for ourselves.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Janeway.#
CHAKOTAY: No. If we shut down the programme, we'd know if he's here or not.#
CHAKOTAY: Every culture has its demons. They embody the darkest emotions of its people. Giving them physical form in heroic literature is a way of exploring those feelings. The Vok'sha of Rakella Prime believe that hate is a beast which lives inside the stomach. Their greatest mythical hero is a man who ate stones for twenty three days to kill the beast and became a saint.#
CHAKOTAY: That might account for its popularity.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay here.#
CHAKOTAY: You're saying he might have been converted into energy?#
CHAKOTAY: Something's coming.#
CHAKOTAY: I think Grendel may be paying us a visit.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes. I'm a little dizzy, but I think I'm all here.#
CHAKOTAY: After the attack on the shuttle, I had the sensation of floating above my own body. I thought I was dead.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes. I couldn't speak, I couldn't touch anything. But then I found if I concentrated on someone who was in the room with me, I could share their consciousness. At first I could only do little things with the host's body. Push buttons, work a console. As time went on, it became easier to do more. I'm sorry I had to knock you around, Tuvok.#
CHAKOTAY: To be honest, I feel like I never left.#
CHAKOTAY: The away team hasn't arrived at the pre-arranged coordinates, Captain, and they've failed to respond to our hails.#
CHAKOTAY: In any case, it's possible that Torres and the others haven't returned to the beam-out site because they were trapped by these geological shifts. I'd like to lead a team down to investigate, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye Captain. Tuvok, Kim, you're with me.#
CHAKOTAY: Good work.#
CHAKOTAY: According to my tricorder readings they definitely came this way. The question is, where did they go from here?#
CHAKOTAY: What is it.#
CHAKOTAY: What is?#
CHAKOTAY: If these caves were changing configuration while we were here, we certainly would have felt it.#
CHAKOTAY: Away team to Voyager.#
CHAKOTAY: We've run into some type of force field, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Right into a solid wall of rock.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged.#
CHAKOTAY: It's not working, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Three to beam up!#
CHAKOTAY: The other thing we have to consider is that the prisoners may be at greater risk now.#
CHAKOTAY: But if we could get someone inside, we might be able to find our people, and also deactivate the forcefield.#
CHAKOTAY: I have an idea about that, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: It's a fine piece of work, Mister Tuvok. Next time I need a tailor, I'll know just where to look.#
CHAKOTAY: Whatever you say, Paris, but I thought you might like to get out of this place.#
CHAKOTAY: Where are Torres and Durst?#
CHAKOTAY: I was ordered to take him to organ processing.#
CHAKOTAY: I was told you had been.#
CHAKOTAY: My face was just grafted.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, sir.#
CHAKOTAY: Drop it!#
CHAKOTAY: It's Chakotay!#
CHAKOTAY: {OC} Chakotay to Voyager, do you read?#
CHAKOTAY: I've found them, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Three humans and one Klingon to beam up. [Transporter room]#
CHAKOTAY: How are you doing?#
CHAKOTAY: But?#
CHAKOTAY: I'd have to say that you two made quite a team down there.#
CHAKOTAY: Haarkonian?#
CHAKOTAY: Any idea what the Haarkonians want with you now?#
CHAKOTAY: That's a significant detour, Captain. JANEWAY  I'm aware of that, Commander. [Ready room]#
CHAKOTAY: Not yet, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Power fluctuations on deck six, Captain. Mister Tuvok is investigating.#
CHAKOTAY: It might be possible to switch over some systems to conventional isolinear circuits.#
CHAKOTAY: Dalby's always been pretty aggressive. My guess is the man's frustrated. He's not used to dealing with Starfleet protocol and procedures.#
CHAKOTAY: What do you suggest? Dragging him in front of a disciplinary board?#
CHAKOTAY: A crash course in Starfleet operations. Field training.#
CHAKOTAY: Right. Don't worry, Tuvok. I'll tell them to take it easy on you. [Cargo bay]#
CHAKOTAY: You want to give me your version of what happened?#
CHAKOTAY: I see.#
CHAKOTAY: Really?#
CHAKOTAY: And you want to do things the Maquis way?#
CHAKOTAY: That's the Maquis way too, isn't it? And if you want to keep doing it the Maquis was that's fine with me. We can do that tomorrow, the next day, everyday, until you report to Lieutenant Tuvok. You understand me? What? How does a Starfleet crewman answer a question?#
CHAKOTAY: Does anyone else have a problem. [Cargo bay] (Tuvok hands out small PADDs.)#
CHAKOTAY: What about changing over to isolinear circuitry?#
CHAKOTAY: Engines are only at seventy four percent of maximum. That's not enough for a plasma burst.#
CHAKOTAY: Engines are at seventy nine percent of maximum. I think we can risk it.#
CHAKOTAY: Come in, doctor.#
CHAKOTAY: Stop! Doctor, don't do it! Doctor, don't listen to him. He's lying. Step away from the warp core, Doctor, don't do anything that man tells you. You're in danger if you do. None of this is real.#
CHAKOTAY: That's right. But it's not the simulation you think it is. Everything around you is part of a holographic projection that's being created by your programme.#
CHAKOTAY: You're on the holodeck on Voyager. The Captain suggested you take a day off, try a holonovel, so you did. But while you were running the holonovel, there was a kinoplasmic radiation surge in the imaging system. It created a feedback loop between the holodeck computer and your programme. All of this, including Mister Barclay, is a holographic simulation generated by your codes, subroutines and memory circuits.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm a projection. I'm really at the holographic control station in Engineering. You're trapped on the holodeck. We've been monitoring the programme from here and we've been trying to reach you for hours.#
CHAKOTAY: That's because your memory circuits are being eradicated by the feedback loop. We have to get you off the holodeck, transfer you back to Sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: That's not true, Doctor. Because of the feedback loop, if you destroy the simulation, you will be destroyed as well.#
CHAKOTAY: If you shut down this simulation your programme will be wiped out right along with it. There'll be no way to retrieve the lost data. You'll be gone.#
CHAKOTAY: What you're perceiving as pain is really the feedback loop eradicating your memory circuits.#
CHAKOTAY: Don't do anything. We're working on the problem right now. We're close to a solution.#
CHAKOTAY: Doctor, trust me.#
CHAKOTAY: This is all a holographic delusion drawn from people and experiences in your own memory circuits. You are malfunctioning.#
CHAKOTAY: If you listen to her, you'll end up destroying yourself.#
CHAKOTAY: This isn't about what you want. This is about what you are. Just because you're made of projected light and energy doesn't mean you're any less real than someone made of flesh and blood. It doesn't matter what you're made of. What matters is who you are. You're our friend, and we want you back.#
CHAKOTAY: Doctor, we're close to getting you out of here. Try to hold on!#
CHAKOTAY: That's right. We encountered a subspace anomaly and there was a radiation surge in the computer system.#
CHAKOTAY: Your wife?#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, I can see that. (The man and woman leaves, and Paris walks up with Kes, carrying boxes of leafy vegetables.)#
CHAKOTAY: I'd call it an example of indiscreet shipboard fraternisation.#
CHAKOTAY: Deck six. [Mess Hall]#
CHAKOTAY:  This morning I interrupted a couple who were kissing in the turbolift, and I've been wondering if we should establish a policy regarding fraternisation.#
CHAKOTAY:  Of course. But we're in a unique situation here. The development of intimate relationships might cause us problems that wouldn't arise on other ships.#
CHAKOTAY:  Including you?#
CHAKOTAY: Looks like some type of energetic vapour.#
CHAKOTAY: Space dwelling life forms.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I'd like the chance to study them at close range.#
CHAKOTAY: But let's not get too close. We wouldn't want to disturb their natural behaviour.#
CHAKOTAY: Take a look at this. See the way they propel themselves?#
CHAKOTAY: Exactly. But they're achieving incredible speeds. Over three thousand kilometres per second.#
CHAKOTAY: Their internal anatomy's also very unusual. They don't appear to have a digestive system of any kind, but they have an extremely porous outer covering. My guess would be that they absorb nutrients directly from space.#
CHAKOTAY: Feeding at three thousand kilometres per second. Not exactly leisurely dining, is it? [Kes's quarters] (Kes is feeding on an impressive array of dishes when the doorbell chimes. She tries to hide as many as possible in a cupboard before answering.)#
CHAKOTAY: But our exhaust could seriously harm the creatures.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: No change, Captain. We're still being pulled along with the swarm.#
CHAKOTAY: Her last report estimated they'd be finished in another half hour.#
CHAKOTAY: I wasn't even thinking about procreation, but I suppose it's the inevitable outcome. We should consider the fact that it might be necessary for the crew to start having children.#
CHAKOTAY: If it does take seventy five years, we're going to need a replacement crew in about half that time.#
CHAKOTAY: I know, but it's a problem we have to face now.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you prepared to tell them they can't have children?#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, Captain. They seem to be fine.#
CHAKOTAY: Hard to know what's prompting that behaviour. Maybe they think we're making a hostile move.#
CHAKOTAY: Or it could be a difference in gender. It's hard to say without further observation.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, look at this. They're attaching themselves to the large creature the same way they did to us.#
CHAKOTAY: Perhaps in the same way some species are attracted to pheromones.#
CHAKOTAY: Colour change and provocative movement are frequently associated with mating rituals.#
CHAKOTAY: Well, their behaviour toward us and the large creature is similar. It's possible they've mistaken us for a potential mate. [Kes's quarters]#
CHAKOTAY: If the smaller creatures are sexually attracted to our subspace emissions, then the large one may perceive us as a rival. That plasma burst it sent out might have been aggressive posturing.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if I may. Maybe we're going about this backwards.#
CHAKOTAY: Every aggressive move we make results in a more aggressive move by the creature. If we're not prepared to use extreme force to destroy him, we need to rethink our actions.#
CHAKOTAY: If we're right that the creature is responding to us as a sexual rival, we might try behaving in a submissive way. That may appease him. We'd be acknowledging that he's dominant and that we're no match for him.#
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we need to mimic the behaviour of the smaller creatures. We saw them rolling over and changing colour.#
CHAKOTAY: Thank you.#
CHAKOTAY: See what?#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: If the comm. system's malfunctioning, the computer could be misreading our voice commands.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: It looks like we're dealing with more than just a comm. system malfunction.#
CHAKOTAY: So?#
CHAKOTAY: We'd have to get to a transporter room first.#
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to keep trying to get to the Bridge on foot. If the ship has been reconfigured somehow, I can get a deck by deck picture of what it looks like as I go.#
CHAKOTAY: I'll get a tricorder from the storage locker, rig it to emit a photoplasmic trail.#
CHAKOTAY: Some.#
CHAKOTAY: Neelix, what's this about?#
CHAKOTAY: Of course.#
CHAKOTAY: I imagine most people who've been in love have been jealous at one time or another.#
CHAKOTAY: Jealousy's about the fear of losing someone we love. There's no pain greater than that. Neelix, are you afraid you're going to lose Kes to someone?#
CHAKOTAY: Nothing makes us more vulnerable than when we love someone. We can be hurt very easily. But I've always believed that what you get when you love someone is greater than what you risk.#
CHAKOTAY: Not exactly.#
CHAKOTAY: Have you seen anyone else? Any more of the crew?#
CHAKOTAY: I suggest you make your way back. Tell everyone you run into to come with you, and all of you stay put in the Mess Hall. When we figure out what's going on, we'll let you know.#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, what are you doing here?#
CHAKOTAY: You're lost too.#
CHAKOTAY: Can you lead us back to the Bridge?#
CHAKOTAY: None of us has been able to reach the Bridge. In fact, Neelix and I can't seem to get off deck six.#
CHAKOTAY: What was our status when you left the Bridge?#
CHAKOTAY: Then maybe it is possible the distortions are somehow reconfiguring the ship.#
CHAKOTAY: Neelix, let's go. Neelix?#
CHAKOTAY: What makes you say that?#
CHAKOTAY: There's a flaw in your logic.#
CHAKOTAY: You're assuming there's a logical pattern to this maze we're caught in, but so far I haven't seen any evidence of that.#
CHAKOTAY: By the time we figure that pattern out, these distortions may have completely overrun the ship.#
CHAKOTAY: The important thing is for at least one of us to make it back to the Bridge. So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine? That way we'll increase the chances that one of us will be successful.#
CHAKOTAY: Tell me something, Tuvok. What does your logic tell you about navigating a maze that's constantly changing shape?#
CHAKOTAY: Tell me you already made it to the Bridge, and you've come back here to give us a status report.#
CHAKOTAY: That's not all. We lost Neelix too.#
CHAKOTAY: He turned a corner, and he was just gone. We think the spatial distortions are continuously changing the configuration of the corridors.#
CHAKOTAY: This wave is obviously causing some kind of radical reconfiguration of the ship. We've got to try to reverse it. If not, we may never be able to get to the Bridge.#
CHAKOTAY: Ensign?#
CHAKOTAY: What are we waiting for? [Outside the holodeck] (Vessel status 0553 is on the control panel.)#
CHAKOTAY: Look, this part of the ship seems unaffected.#
CHAKOTAY: How long?#
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna's right. It seems to me we've got two options. One, we find a way to get ourselves out of this implosion ring, or two, we find some way of reversing it.#
CHAKOTAY: Exactly.#
CHAKOTAY: Do you have another suggestion, Mister Tuvok?#
CHAKOTAY: All right, B'Elanna. Let's give your plan a shot. You#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, Lieutenant?#
CHAKOTAY: In case you haven't noticed, Captain Janeway's not in any condition to make decisions. I'm in command. Is that understood?#
CHAKOTAY: Good. B'Elanna, you and Harry get down to Engineering. Evacuate whoever's on duty, then initiate the warp pulse. Move it.#
CHAKOTAY: They're heating up the warp core. They must be close to initiating the shock burst. Everybody take cover.#
CHAKOTAY: Can I talk to her?#
CHAKOTAY: Captain!#
CHAKOTAY: What's wrong with her?#
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, this ring has passed through the shields, crushed the hull, twisted the ship. We'll never get enough power from the holoemitters to stop it.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you suggesting we just let it crush us?#
CHAKOTAY: I agree. It sounds completely illogical.#
CHAKOTAY: Whatever this thing is, B'Elanna, it's bigger and more powerful than we are. Maybe, maybe this is one bear we can't wrestle to the ground. Maybe like Tuvok says there's nothing we can do but let it happen, and hope for the best.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, Mister Tuvok?#
CHAKOTAY: You know, Tuvok, I may not get another chance to say this. Sometimes I find you arrogant and irritating, but you're a hell of an officer.#
CHAKOTAY: I suppose it must have been tough for you to accept my being elevated to first officer over you.#
CHAKOTAY: Hi.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm trying to contact my spirit guide.#
CHAKOTAY: Who knows what's going to happen when that ring hits us. We might be in for another long journey.#
CHAKOTAY: I thought you'd never ask. (Torres sits down, and they hold hands. Paris puts his hand on Kim's shoulder as the distortion passes through Chakotay and Torres. They are next. Tuvok nearly touches Janeway as it heads towards him. Shortly after, everyone is solid again.)#
CHAKOTAY: What was?#
CHAKOTAY: We've got a full crew complement, Captain. No injuries reported.#
CHAKOTAY: I guess whoever they were, they want to know everything they can about us too.#
CHAKOTAY: A-koo-chee-moya. I pray on this day of memories to speak to my father, the one whom the wind called Kolopak. Though I am far from his bones, perhaps there is a spirit in these unnamed skies who will find him and honour him with my song. A-koo-chee-moya. [Kazon bridge] (The shuttlecraft is on the viewscreen.)#
CHAKOTAY: Computer, report.#
CHAKOTAY: Source?#
CHAKOTAY: Computer, open a channel to the Kazon vessel. This is Commander Chakotay of the Federation Starship Voyager. Why have you fired on me?#
CHAKOTAY: I wasn't aware of that. I have no hostile intentions. Power down your weapons and I'll leave.#
CHAKOTAY: Look, son, my starship is only a few light years away.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kazon vessel. Listen carefully. I do not want a fight. Stand down or I'll be forced to return fire.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kazon vessel. I've established a direct weapons lock on your engine core. This is my final warning. If you don't stand down, I will destroy your ship.#
CHAKOTAY: All right, if that's the way you want to play it.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kazon vessel. Do you read me? Computer, are there any life signs inside the Kazon vessel?#
CHAKOTAY: Kazon ship, your engine core is critical. You have less than thirty seconds to evacuate. Do you read me? If you have an escape pod, you must eject now. Computer, establish a transporter lock on the lifeform.#
CHAKOTAY: Prepare to beam him aboard.#
CHAKOTAY: Energise.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager. Chakotay to Voyager. Computer, damage report.#
CHAKOTAY: Great! Welcome aboard. [Ready room] (Voyager is orbiting a planet. Neelix brings a dish of food to Janeway.)#
CHAKOTAY: You're welcome.#
CHAKOTAY: It's a human expression. You thank me for saving your life, I say, you're welcome. I accept your surrender. Look, I promise you, as soon as we get back to Voyager, we'll find a Kazon ship and hand you over to them.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not in the habit of killing children.#
CHAKOTAY: What's your name, son?#
CHAKOTAY: Your name.#
CHAKOTAY: I want to let them know you're on board.#
CHAKOTAY: Computer, open a channel. Kazon vessel, I have a young man on board you might know. He goes by the name of Kar. I'd say he's about thirteen. I'd like to arrange for his transfer before I return to my ship. Computer, confirm channel is open.#
CHAKOTAY: Talk to them. Tell them you're okay.#
CHAKOTAY: Full reverse.#
CHAKOTAY: They're pulling us in.#
CHAKOTAY: Why are you so eager for me to kill you?#
CHAKOTAY: Look. If you check your long-range sensors, you'll find a big ship out there. It's called Voyager, and by now it's on its way to find me.#
CHAKOTAY: I have a fair idea why I'm here, but why are they doing this to you?#
CHAKOTAY: Who's Razik? You tell this Razik that Federation Commander Chakotay demands to see him.#
CHAKOTAY: Razik is obviously your leader. I'm hoping if he's strong enough to be in command, he's wise enough to listen to reason.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not at war with you.#
CHAKOTAY: We're not familiar with this part of space. If I'd seen a map identifying this as Kazon-Ogla territory, I wouldn't have been anywhere near it.#
CHAKOTAY: I guess if he had killed me, my uniform would've made you all a fine trophy.#
CHAKOTAY: Uniforms maybe, but not like mine.#
CHAKOTAY: You get them involved young, Haliz.#
CHAKOTAY: So they brought you here to see your first human. Take a good look. You won't see any hate in my eyes. I'm a gentle man from a gentle people who wish you no harm.#
CHAKOTAY: I know you'd like them to hate me, Razik, but I want their first impression of humans to be a good one.#
CHAKOTAY: What for?#
CHAKOTAY: You want me to kill a child in front of other children? What would it accomplish?#
CHAKOTAY: If I refuse? (No answer. The weapon drops to the floor. Chakotay bends to pick it up, attacks Razik and gets him on his knees with arms pinned behind his back. He holds the weapon to the leader's head.) CHAKOTAY: I'll be needing my shuttle back.#
CHAKOTAY: That's a chance I'm willing to take. What about you?#
CHAKOTAY: Want to come? There doesn't seem to be much of a future for you here.#
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, he's only stunned.#
CHAKOTAY: It didn't take them long to get those weapons back online, did it? Computer, prepare to go to warp.#
CHAKOTAY: You're the boss. Initiate evasive pattern theta two. Full impulse.#
CHAKOTAY: It may mean something to you to die a violent death, but I'd like to get out of this without killing or being killed.#
CHAKOTAY: Sounds about right. Computer, damage report.#
CHAKOTAY: We're not going to make it like this. Computer, scan for an M-class atmosphere.#
CHAKOTAY: Anybody training there now? Computer, lay in a course to the moon. Evasive pattern omega one. Maximum impulse.#
CHAKOTAY: Computer, prepare for long-range transport. Two to beam to the surface.#
CHAKOTAY: Kar.#
CHAKOTAY: The computer said that transport wasn't recommended. It didn't say it was impossible. With any luck, Razik will think we didn't survive the explosion. Then maybe you'll get your name for dying in battle.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, you're stranded here with me, and I'm stranded here with you, because for some reason that escapes me at the moment, I keep saving your life. Now, if you want to hate me for that, fine. But I'd really appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.#
CHAKOTAY: To yourself! First thing we've got to do is find some shelter and get out of this heat. Any suggestions?#
CHAKOTAY: I think we're finally beginning to understand each other.#
CHAKOTAY: What did I just say?#
CHAKOTAY: What the hell was that?#
CHAKOTAY: Charming.#
CHAKOTAY: So I guess you know your way around.#
CHAKOTAY: Well, it looks like you just saved my life. Twice more and we'll be even. [Briefing room]#
CHAKOTAY: I'm setting my tricorder to emit a homing signal.#
CHAKOTAY: So when my people show up, they'll know where to look for me.#
CHAKOTAY: They're very persistent. I'm betting they haven't given up on me.#
CHAKOTAY: You just won't give up, will you?#
CHAKOTAY: Not Federation. Chakotay. That's my name.#
CHAKOTAY: No, not exactly.#
CHAKOTAY: My name was a gift from my tribe. I cherish it every day of my life, just as I cherish the Federation uniform.#
CHAKOTAY: Your name, my uniform. Not much difference. We both have to earn them.#
CHAKOTAY: Study. Years of study. Learning about science and ships and navigation.#
CHAKOTAY: No. They prepared us to defend ourselves in battle. They prepared us very well. And we had to pass many difficult tests before we were given the right to wear the uniform.#
CHAKOTAY: Why? What's so different about us, aside from the fact that I keep saving your life and you keep threatening to kill me?#
CHAKOTAY: Let me tell you something. I have no interest in your territory or anybody else's. My people taught me a man does not own land. He doesn't own anything but the courage and loyalty in his heart. That's where my power comes from. I think we both could use some sleep, don't you? (Later, Chakotay is sleeping when Kar picks up the tricorder and turns it off. Then he points the weapon at Chakotay, but he can't pull the trigger and throws it away. He opens the tricorder again and sits down.)#
CHAKOTAY: Good morning. How did you sleep?#
CHAKOTAY: Really? You seemed a little restless to me.#
CHAKOTAY: All that skulking around, throwing things.#
CHAKOTAY: You think I'm going to get much sleep around an Ogla warrior who's threatened to kill me? Why didn't you go through with it?#
CHAKOTAY: I don't believe that. I don't believe you do either. I think maybe you're beginning to realise I'm not your enemy, and only a fool would kill a friend.#
CHAKOTAY: Would any other Kazon sect accept you?#
CHAKOTAY: How many Kazon sects are there?#
CHAKOTAY: I guess you could come with us.#
CHAKOTAY: You wouldn't have to wear a uniform.#
CHAKOTAY: Tell me about the other uniforms, the ones the Kazon fought.#
CHAKOTAY: People coming this way, humans and Kazon.#
CHAKOTAY: There's only one way back to the Ogla for you, and that's if you earn your name. So I guess that's what you'll have to do.#
CHAKOTAY: You're going to have to kill me.#
CHAKOTAY: According to my readings, the away team's only fifty metres away.#
CHAKOTAY: And alert Sickbay to prepare for a code white resuscitation.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't have time to explain now.#
CHAKOTAY: It'll be all right. Our technology can revive me even if I'm brain dead for two minutes.#
CHAKOTAY: Like you said, it's my fault you don't have your name. I can't leave you behind like this.#
CHAKOTAY: I understand.#
CHAKOTAY: A-koo-chee-moya. I pray on this day of memories to speak to my father, the one whom the wind called Kolopak. Father, if you can hear me among these unnamed stars, I ask you to continue to watch over me as you've always done. I ask you also to watch over a boy called Karden, who has a difficult path to travel. A-koo-chee-moya.#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, can you boost the transporter signal?#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: We think your shuttlecraft was caught in some kind of temporal anomaly.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, you could call it that.#
CHAKOTAY: Good news and bad. We have located an M class planet, and it shows high amino acid and protein readings.#
CHAKOTAY: It's a full day out of our way.#
CHAKOTAY: And our long range sensors can't confirm any plant life on the surface.#
CHAKOTAY: It's one strange planet, Captain. It's shrouded. Vapours cover it like a curtain. EM disturbances all over the atmosphere.#
CHAKOTAY: The people in Stellar Cartography have already nicknamed it Planet Hell.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I don't know what we'll find when we get to the surface. Flora or fauna, friend or foe.#
CHAKOTAY: High levels of trigemic vapours, but it should still support humanoid life.#
CHAKOTAY: Could you provide some sort of skin protection that might help?#
CHAKOTAY: I'll have Mister Kim take a look. [Mess hall]#
CHAKOTAY: How occasional, and how long would they last?#
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Torres.#
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, our shuttle's in trouble. Any progress on modifying the transporter? [Transporter room]#
CHAKOTAY: Or something on it.#
CHAKOTAY: Where does that leave us with the transporter?#
CHAKOTAY: So there's no way to know how close they'll be to the window when it opens.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you going to be able to warn us before the window closes again?#
CHAKOTAY: A covariant phaser pulse into their aft control systems might disable their entire weapons array.#
CHAKOTAY: Shields at eighty percent.#
CHAKOTAY: They couldn't be preparing to ram us, could they?#
CHAKOTAY: Understood.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. [Outside the cave] (Paris scratches while Neelix paces.)#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: I know he's been doing research. I'll check with him.#
CHAKOTAY: Good idea.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes.#
CHAKOTAY: Of course.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, you've trained your crew well. We'll be able to do without you for a few days. In the meantime, we're continuing diagnostics on all ship's systems. There's a reason for what's happening to you, and we're not stopping until we find it.#
CHAKOTAY: Call me if there's anything I can do.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, ma'am.#
CHAKOTAY: That must be our welcoming party.#
CHAKOTAY: On screen.#
CHAKOTAY: She's not available right now. I'm Commander Chakotay, the First Officer. I can speak for her.#
CHAKOTAY: I understand, but she's not able to come to the Bridge now. And in her absence, our protocols allow me to assume her place. Our request is the same. We'd like permission to cross through your space. We'll do it as quickly as possible.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure why that information is necessary.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't know how to convince you, but we're a peaceful people. If you doubt us#
CHAKOTAY: What happened?#
CHAKOTAY: Reverse course, Mister Paris.#
CHAKOTAY: Evasive manoeuvre gamma five.#
CHAKOTAY: Report!#
CHAKOTAY: Get the weapons online.#
CHAKOTAY: Return fire.#
CHAKOTAY: There's no crew?#
CHAKOTAY: Return fire, Tuvok.#
CHAKOTAY: Get us out of here, Paris.#
CHAKOTAY: All stop.#
CHAKOTAY: On screen.#
CHAKOTAY: It's the same all over the ship. On my way here, I must have seen fifty people just sitting, staring.#
CHAKOTAY: I think we should take an escape pod. We passed an M Class planet yesterday. The pod should get us there in a week. We can try to get help.#
CHAKOTAY: It may be our only hope. If we stay here, we'll end up like the others.#
CHAKOTAY: Do I have to give you an order?#
CHAKOTAY: I want you with me.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm the Chakotay you want me to be. The one who loves you. This is what you want, isn't it? The secret you've been keeping? You want us to be together.  And we can be. [Torres' quarters] (Chakotay throws Torres down on the bed.)#
CHAKOTAY: I want you. I've always wanted you. You feel the same way too.#
CHAKOTAY: Anything?#
CHAKOTAY:  Pack it up. We'll find better quality somewhere down the line.#
CHAKOTAY: What have you got, Lieutenant?#
CHAKOTAY: Oh, just something somebody told me once.#
CHAKOTAY: I hated every minute of it. My father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his. Away from my friends, my home, and here we were in the middle of a brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the ancient Rubber People.#
CHAKOTAY: Believe me, it was. And he was very disappointed that I didn't share his enthusiasm. He'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years.#
CHAKOTAY: The one on the right is the one I found today.#
CHAKOTAY: I can give you an official Rubber Tree People theory if you like. Sky Spirits.#
CHAKOTAY: It's an ancient myth. Sky Spirits from above created the first Rubber People in their own image and led the way to a sacred land where the Rubber People would live for eternity.#
CHAKOTAY: How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve? Hasn't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process?#
CHAKOTAY: I don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities.#
CHAKOTAY: My father would put on his expedition hat and shout, let's go. I guess that's good enough for me.#
CHAKOTAY: Could be some kind of cloaking technology.#
CHAKOTAY: Understood.#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, you're with me. Mister Neelix, please report to Transporter room three for an away mission.#
CHAKOTAY: Problem?#
CHAKOTAY: Storm?#
CHAKOTAY: Fine. We'll take a shuttle.#
CHAKOTAY: Nothing we can't handle. Relax, Neelix. [Memory - Central American jungle] (It is pouring with rain. The expedition are sheltering in a cave.)#
CHAKOTAY: Decreasing speed to seven hundred twenty kph. Entering terminal approach phase.#
CHAKOTAY: Touchdown site scanned. Continuing descent.#
CHAKOTAY: Then I guess we'll have to search for these people the old fashioned way, with our eyes and ears.#
CHAKOTAY: No. It just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once. The Central American rain forest on Earth. It's the only other place in the universe that I've ever seen this flower.#
CHAKOTAY: I hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical surveyors. Collect a sample of that flower. B'Elanna?#
CHAKOTAY: Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship. We should be able to.#
CHAKOTAY: I'll be damned.#
CHAKOTAY: It almost looks like a hawk, doesn't it? [Memory - Central American jungle] (A hawk flies overhead.)#
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead, Neelix.#
CHAKOTAY: Neelix, what the?#
CHAKOTAY: Away team to Voyager.#
CHAKOTAY: Emergency beam out. Get Neelix to Sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: We can't discount that.#
CHAKOTAY: They're out there. Our tricorders may not tell us so, but they're out there. Lay down your weapons.#
CHAKOTAY: Disarm. I want them to see that we don't pose any threat to them.#
CHAKOTAY: I know all about Starfleet protocol, Lieutenant.#
CHAKOTAY: The logical course isn't always the right course. Lay down your weapons in plain sight. Those are my orders.#
CHAKOTAY: Negative. We'll show no force of any kind.#
CHAKOTAY: Noted. [Memory - Central American village] (Kolopak's party lay down their weapons.)#
CHAKOTAY: All right. Let's get back to the shuttle.#
CHAKOTAY: Hey, wait!#
CHAKOTAY: No shuttle. Well, at least they got out okay.#
CHAKOTAY: You have nothing to fear from me. Talk to me. Let me see you.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm sorry. I don't know the ancient language of my people. I can't understand. (Beings enter behind him, still talking. Chakotay remembers the symbol his father drew in the soil, and its name.) CHAKOTAY: Chamozi.#
CHAKOTAY: Chamozi. (The leader turns Chakotay's face to look at his tattoo. The same mark is on his forehead, too.)#
CHAKOTAY: Yes.#
CHAKOTAY: I wear it to honour my father. He wore it to honour his ancestors.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes. Not many, but some.#
CHAKOTAY: There was a time when that was true, but no longer.#
CHAKOTAY: Inheritors?#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I understand.#
CHAKOTAY: My people called you the Sky Spirits. Why have you been hiding from us since we landed here?#
CHAKOTAY: Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions.#
CHAKOTAY: As I said, we've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by.#
CHAKOTAY: You were generous to offer as much as you did.#
CHAKOTAY: I wish I could see my father's face right now.#
CHAKOTAY: No. He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony. Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes. Yes, he did. We weren't on very good terms when he died. Once he was gone, I didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how to heal our old wounds. I returned to my colony and continued the fight in his name. I took the mark that he wore to honour his ancestors. I spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered. Until now.#
CHAKOTAY: Put those away.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, Father. I hear him. I finally hear him.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Engineering. We're picking up life signs. Is your compass working?#
CHAKOTAY: That looks a lot like the Caretaker's array.#
CHAKOTAY: Shields! (Energy pulses, like the ones the Caretaker used to power the Ocampa's underground habitat, fire at Voyager. Boom!) CHAKOTAY: Definitely weapons.#
CHAKOTAY: Kes, is there any Ocampa history about people who left your planet, or were captured by aliens and taken away?#
CHAKOTAY: None of that is true. We never attacked anyone except in self defence.#
CHAKOTAY: Does she occupy our space-time continuum?#
CHAKOTAY: What's going on?#
CHAKOTAY: Red alert. Bridge to Janeway. Bridge to Janeway.#
CHAKOTAY: Increase power to structural reinforcement.#
CHAKOTAY: Whatever she wants us for, it better be good. Bridge. I had you right where I wanted you.#
CHAKOTAY: I was just lulling you into a false sense of security.#
CHAKOTAY: I'll win the next couple of points, then you'll start to tense up.#
CHAKOTAY: Easy, B'Elanna. It's only hoverball.#
CHAKOTAY: A beacon?#
CHAKOTAY: See if you can authenticate the signal.#
CHAKOTAY: I'd advise against bringing it on board before we've gotten a look at it, even if it is emitting a Federation signal.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't know.#
CHAKOTAY: Set the shield harmonics to rotate continuously.#
CHAKOTAY: It's as if they know our access codes.#
CHAKOTAY: Mister Kim, did you reroute power to Transporter room two?#
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Tuvok. [Cargo bay]#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Engaging tractor beam. I've got them, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: I should have known you were involved.#
CHAKOTAY: Attempting to compensate.#
CHAKOTAY: From the look of these sensor readings, Seska wants us to come after her.#
CHAKOTAY: I think Seska's leading us into another trap. She masterminded a precision raid that made us look like first year Academy students, but she left a warp trail for us to follow. After such a flawless performance, why would she suddenly made that kind of mistake?#
CHAKOTAY: No, I agree with everything you said about preventing the spread of our technology. But conventional tactics aren't going to work with Seska. We'll need to come at her with a few surprises of our own.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm betting Seska's figured out a way to shield the module from our transporters. We might have to destroy it instead.#
CHAKOTAY: We borrow a trick from Seska's book. Remember how we disabled the computer core on the Cardassian frigate orbiting Bajor?#
CHAKOTAY: Exactly.#
CHAKOTAY: One thing at a time.#
CHAKOTAY: Why shouldn't I?#
CHAKOTAY: Oh no? I let her join the Maquis. I took her into my confidence. I even got intimately involved with her.#
CHAKOTAY: Well, I for one, am through being manipulated by her.#
CHAKOTAY: So now I'm getting advice about controlling my emotions from you. [Kazon briefing room]#
CHAKOTAY: Computer, when will we intercept the Kazon vessel?#
CHAKOTAY: Reduce power to maneuvering thrusters, and life support to five percent. Cut all power to other systems. [Kazon bridge]#
CHAKOTAY: Computer, initiate continuous scans for the transporter oscillator.#
CHAKOTAY: Target a concentrated beam to these coordinates.#
CHAKOTAY: Initiate.#
CHAKOTAY: Great. Computer, launch the automated message beacon.#
CHAKOTAY: Now take the inertial dampers offline. [Kazon bridge]#
CHAKOTAY: I'm right here.#
CHAKOTAY: Activate the message beacon. Lovely to see you again.#
CHAKOTAY: I see the Nistrim take orders from you now.#
CHAKOTAY: Lucky me.#
CHAKOTAY: No, thanks.#
CHAKOTAY: I have no interest in reminiscing with you. I destroyed the transporter module. The game's over.#
CHAKOTAY: I think you'll find that technology useless. I wiped the computer core before I transported.#
CHAKOTAY: So if you're going to have me killed, just do it.#
CHAKOTAY: You can't possibly believe that you and I could still#
CHAKOTAY: If you think I'm going to give you those codes, you don't know me as well as you think you do.#
CHAKOTAY: Why are you telling me this?#
CHAKOTAY: I'm touched.#
CHAKOTAY: Voyager's not coming. I left them explicit instructions not to follow me, so you can stop worrying about people getting hurt.#
CHAKOTAY: She's quite a woman, isn't she? Does she rub your shoulders and tell you you're the most exciting man she's ever known? That's what she used to do for me. What's a matter? Didn't she tell you about us?#
CHAKOTAY: Flattery, devotion, sex. I always thought she had a lot to offer a man.#
CHAKOTAY: You're wrong, Culluh. I'm telling you exactly what you need to know. She's using you.#
CHAKOTAY: You've done an even better job on him than you did on me.#
CHAKOTAY: Then what's she doing here? Watching you work? She used to like to watch me work, too.#
CHAKOTAY: You know one thing I especially liked? The little mole on her stomach. I guess you've seen it.#
CHAKOTAY: I'll give you something better.#
CHAKOTAY: First hand information.#
CHAKOTAY: When Seska's through with you, she's going to kill you.#
CHAKOTAY: About keeping our technology out of Kazon hands. I thought if I did it on my own, I could keep the rest of the crew out of danger.#
CHAKOTAY: Seska was my problem, a problem I felt it was my duty to solve.#
CHAKOTAY: I thought I was doing the right thing.#
CHAKOTAY: If that's so, I regret it.#
CHAKOTAY: It means something to me, Captain. It means I've let you down, and for that I'm truly sorry.#
CHAKOTAY: No. I think I've spent enough time alone with Seska.#
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. How bad is it?#
CHAKOTAY: Options?#
CHAKOTAY: I don't want to leave the ship defenceless this close to a hostile planet.#
CHAKOTAY: All right, power down the shields.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, Neelix.#
CHAKOTAY: Did you get the tellerium?#
CHAKOTAY: Then we need you here. Prepare to beam directly to Engineering.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to away team. Captain, can you hear me?#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, Torres, please respond.#
CHAKOTAY: Begin rerouting power back to all key systems. What happened down there?#
CHAKOTAY: Are you sure it was the Mokra?#
CHAKOTAY: Any idea how the Mokra knew you were down there?#
CHAKOTAY: Could your contact be one of them?#
CHAKOTAY: They've probably got the resistance movement under surveillance.#
CHAKOTAY: Good work, Mister Kim. Mister Neelix, you're with me. I think it's time we contacted the Mokra.#
CHAKOTAY: Mister Paris, set a new course. Bring us out from behind the moon and establish a standard orbit around the planet. Slowly. We don't want to look aggressive.#
CHAKOTAY: What kind of response can we expect when they see us?#
CHAKOTAY: On screen.#
CHAKOTAY: Commander Chakotay of the Federation starship Voyager.#
CHAKOTAY: No. Some of my crewmembers have already been to the surface. We've lost contact with them.#
CHAKOTAY: I have reason to believe they're being detained.#
CHAKOTAY: Thank you.#
CHAKOTAY: If there's any chance for a diplomatic solution, we have to pursue it. In the meantime, I want continuous scans of the surface. Standard search pattern. [Detention cell] (Torres is examining the yellow glowing barrier around the doorway.)#
CHAKOTAY: I assure you we have no hostile intentions.#
CHAKOTAY: But not you.#
CHAKOTAY: Then I'd like to talk to my crewmembers.#
CHAKOTAY: I'll consider that, after I talk to my crewmembers.#
CHAKOTAY: Talk to your contacts again. I want an alternative to sitting here waiting for him to get back to us. [Detention cell]#
CHAKOTAY: Can you find a way to beam through them? The Mokra aren't familiar with transporter technology.#
CHAKOTAY: Too dangerous. We can't risk beaming in. We have to find another way that the Mokra won't detect. Sounds like a challenge for you, Mister Kim. [Market place]#
CHAKOTAY: So much for a surprise attack.#
CHAKOTAY: And they won't know where to concentrate their defences.#
CHAKOTAY: Then it'll have to do. How long will it take to modify the deflector?#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Paris. Is the rescue team ready?#
CHAKOTAY: Prepare for transport.#
CHAKOTAY: Initiate the radion beams.#
CHAKOTAY: Begin the transport.#
CHAKOTAY: Maximum shields. Damage report.#
CHAKOTAY: On screen.#
CHAKOTAY: Give me some good news, Mister Kim.#
CHAKOTAY: That qualifies. Good work.#
CHAKOTAY: Can we get through?#
CHAKOTAY: That's a big assumption.#
CHAKOTAY: In about thirty seconds the Mokra are going to open fire. I don't know how long we're going to be able to wait for you.#
CHAKOTAY: Full power to the shields.#
CHAKOTAY: Modulate the shield frequencies. Try to throw off their sensors.#
CHAKOTAY: Redirect all warp power to the shields.#
CHAKOTAY: We've got to get out of their weapons range. Scan one more time for the away team.#
CHAKOTAY: Prepare to break orbit.#
CHAKOTAY: Where are you taking us, Mister Kim?#
CHAKOTAY: A blind spot?#
CHAKOTAY: How long do you thing this'll work.#
CHAKOTAY: I'll take every second I can get. [Prison complex]#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to transporter room two. Do we have them?#
CHAKOTAY: Gladly. Lieutenant, you heard her. [Ready room]#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, someone's initiating a transport. It's Torres and the robot.#
CHAKOTAY: Their shielding is making it difficult to get clear readings. I can't even tell you what their weapons capabilities are.#
CHAKOTAY: They're firing some kind of quantum resonance charges, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: We've got to get out of here.#
CHAKOTAY: Injury reports from all decks. [Pralor vessel]#
CHAKOTAY: We're losing life support, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: We're talking about at least another six days of repairs.#
CHAKOTAY: But if we can manoeuvre inside the field#
CHAKOTAY: Attack them again?#
CHAKOTAY: You don't mind if the rest of us give you a little help, do you, Paris? I'd hate to lose another shuttle.#
CHAKOTAY: We're making progress on the dilithium matrix. It should be stable enough to reinitialise the warp core in about six hours.#
CHAKOTAY: When we were in the Maquis, B'Elanna once linked a holo-emitter to a deflector array and projected an image of another ship into space.#
CHAKOTAY: We will by the time the warp core's online. I already have Kim working on the holodeck to#
CHAKOTAY: We've got to get Torres back now.#
CHAKOTAY: It didn't work. He bounced right off the field.#
CHAKOTAY: It's trajectory is erratic, and our sensors aren't detecting any stellar or planetary gravitational fields that could account for its motion.#
CHAKOTAY: And yet it looks, feels, and tastes just like a comet.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain?#
CHAKOTAY: I'm showing a large build-up of baryonic particles.#
CHAKOTAY: By a ship?#
CHAKOTAY: How about Stellar Cartography?#
CHAKOTAY: Well, that's going to be a problem with just about everything we assign him to.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain!#
CHAKOTAY: We must have hurt them.#
CHAKOTAY: We'd better hope they don't come back. We're sitting ducks.#
CHAKOTAY: We've had casualties on all decks, no fatalities so far.#
CHAKOTAY: Crewman Bendera's dead. The Doctor couldn't do anything.#
CHAKOTAY: I'll get right on it.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes. Like it or not, it seems we're in a situation where the rules have changed. And maybe, if we're going to survive out here, we have to start changing too.#
CHAKOTAY: When we first started our trip home, you made a conscious decision to treat Voyager as a Starfleet ship with a Starfleet crew following Starfleet rules.#
CHAKOTAY: Starfleet works well in the Alpha quadrant, but out here, maybe we should be thinking more like the Maquis. The Maquis had to survive on their own. We were up against insurmountable odds. We had to create our own opportunities for success, because nobody was willing to help us. Sound like anybody you know?#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, this was the fourth attack in two weeks. We've lost three crew members to the Kazon, a dozen more have sustained serious injuries. The ship has taken so much damage we'll be lucky to get warp drive online again. And we can count on the fact that the Kazon will be back. I don't think we can afford to keep doing business as usual. [Mess hall] CHAKOTAY: A lot of us can say we're alive today because of Kurt Bendera. There was never a better man to have at your side, never anyone more willing to take on the tough jobs. The first time I met him was in a mining community on Telfas Prime. Some of the miners objected to my sense of humour and decided they should break a few of my bones. There were four of them and one of me, and I was taking a beating. Suddenly this man I'd never seen before came out of nowhere and evened things up. We stood back to back, and pretty soon the others decided my sense of humour wasn't so bad after all. I thanked the man. He just grinned and said, I like a good fight. He was my friend from that moment on, and he kept fighting the good fight right up to the end. I'll miss him. Ensign. (Everyone stands. The Ensign blows a bosun's pipe, presumably to pipe Bendera off the ship, and the service finishes.)#
CHAKOTAY: But that's not why he thinks we should give the Kazon what they want.#
CHAKOTAY: You have, but a lot of the crew feel they haven't had the chance to voice their opinions.#
CHAKOTAY: A lot of the Maquis feel the Federation abandoned them years ago. You may be willing to die for Federation principles, but they're not.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't. But isn't there something in between your position and his?#
CHAKOTAY: All I'm saying, Captain, is that maybe there's a little room for flexibility in interpreting Starfleet's protocols. Frankly I'm not sure they were ever intended for situations like this.#
CHAKOTAY: Maybe this situation with the Kazon is the first example. Maybe we have to examine Starfleet's principles with a cold eye and ask ourselves if they're really applicable here.#
CHAKOTAY: Make a deal, an alliance.#
CHAKOTAY: With one of their factions, or two. If we had the Ogla and the Relora as our allies, the others would be afraid to touch us.#
CHAKOTAY: With all due respect, maybe that's because your imagination is limited by Starfleet protocols. As Captain, you're responsible for making decisions in the best interest of your crew, and I think you have to ask yourself if you're doing that. [Tuvok's quarters] (Tuvok is tending his orchids when the doorbell rings.)#
CHAKOTAY: You've got to be kidding!#
CHAKOTAY: I think it's a bad idea.#
CHAKOTAY: Fine. I'll talk with Seska.#
CHAKOTAY: Yellow alert, all hands at the ready.#
CHAKOTAY: Red alert!#
CHAKOTAY: What are you doing on a Kazon ship?#
CHAKOTAY: It happened over thirty years ago and the Kazon are still trying to punish you?#
CHAKOTAY: It seems to me that they've learned their lesson. Mabus and his people have freely acknowledged that they were responsible for what happened to them.#
CHAKOTAY: The Trabe have a lot of ships and a lot of weapons in that convoy. I think this alliance would be better than none at all.#
CHAKOTAY: Who sent him?#
CHAKOTAY: One of the Majes.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I think you should consider not going to the conference.#
CHAKOTAY: To be honest, it's almost frightening. Up till now, it's all been theory. I never thought it would actually happen. Are we ready for it?#
CHAKOTAY: Increase sensor gain to maximum.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: How do we do that?#
CHAKOTAY: We're having trouble tracking him. We can't get power to the internal sensors. Tuvok has security teams searching deck by deck.#
CHAKOTAY: Localise it.#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok doesn't have any security in that area. Chakotay to Tuvok. We think Paris may be on deck six. Deploy security to sections twenty one through twenty seven alpha. (Paris gently puts Janeway on the floor of a shuttlecraft, then takes the helm.)#
CHAKOTAY: What?#
CHAKOTAY: Tractor beam.#
CHAKOTAY: Maintain a sensor lock on that shuttle.#
CHAKOTAY: Engage warp engines. Follow them.#
CHAKOTAY: Increase speed to match.#
CHAKOTAY: Are we in tractor range?#
CHAKOTAY: Reduce sped to warp nine point five. Keep a sensor lock on them as long as you can.#
CHAKOTAY: Natural?#
CHAKOTAY: What do we do about it?#
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead.#
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Tuvok, have a security team meet us in Transporter room three. [Planet surface] (Night. A pair of giant salamanders are lying on the shore by a river. Tuvok and Chakotay, and two security guards, beam down. The salamanders react to their torches, and Chakotay stuns them.) CHAKOTAY: There are traces of human DNA. It's them. But I have to admit, I'm not sure which one is the Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't know how I'm going to enter this into the log.#
CHAKOTAY: No, not really. I've just never really been comfortable with Suder, that's all. It's not like he ever did anything wrong, it's just#
CHAKOTAY: As in killing Cardassians.#
CHAKOTAY: You weren't with him in battle. Around us he was the quietest, most unassuming guy you'll ever meet. Typical Betazoid, Kept to himself. I never knew much about him.#
CHAKOTAY: A lot of us were doing what we were doing to protect our families, but Suder had his own reasons. I wish I could tell you what they were. In combat there was something in his eyes.#
CHAKOTAY: Sometimes I had to pull him back, stop him from going too far. And once or twice when I did he looked at me with those cold eyes and I just knew he was this far away from killing me.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't put down hunches or bad feelings in my crew evaluations, Lieutenant. A Vulcan should appreciate that.#
CHAKOTAY: I wasn't going to make it harder for any of them here. Suder did his job when he was serving with me and he's done his job since he's been on this ship.#
CHAKOTAY: There won't be any more winners.#
CHAKOTAY: I've heard you're responsible for this, Lieutenant.#
CHAKOTAY: With a senior officer running a gambling operation and skimming profits from each days proceeds? Now why would Starfleet have a problem with that? Since you all seem to have extra replicator rations you won't be needing these. Today's pot is hereby confiscated. The Captain's put a lot of faith in you, Mister Paris. She'll be disappointed. You're on report.#
CHAKOTAY: I haven't seen many weapons that could do that kind of damage to a duritanium hull.#
CHAKOTAY: Continuous scans, Lieutenant. We don't want whoever did this to catch us by surprise.#
CHAKOTAY: Afraid so.#
CHAKOTAY: Probably the same way we did.#
CHAKOTAY: Originally the Cardassians sent this thing to destroy a Maquis munitions base. We nicknamed it Dreadnought. It's a self-guided tactical missile carrying a charge of a thousand kilos of matter and another thousand of antimatter.#
CHAKOTAY: We didn't. It got through all our defences. Worked like it was supposed to except for one minor detail. It didn't go off.#
CHAKOTAY: The missile skipped off into the atmosphere and quietly went into orbit.#
CHAKOTAY: And we gave it a new mission. To destroy the Cardassian fuel depot on Aschelan Five. But it never made it out of the Badlands. We thought it had been destroyed in one of the plasma storms.#
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant. I expect everyone to show up for meetings on time and properly dressed.#
CHAKOTAY: On screen.#
CHAKOTAY: It's not supposed to do that until it's locked onto it's final target.#
CHAKOTAY: The planet is Class M. I'm reading several heavily populated areas. [Secret location]#
CHAKOTAY: The Dreadnought's quantum torpedoes could be modified to be compatible with our launchers.#
CHAKOTAY: We should also download some files from the computer core.#
CHAKOTAY: We're back on a heading to Rakosa Five.#
CHAKOTAY: At this rate it'll reach the planet in fifty one hours.#
CHAKOTAY: Torres programmed the missile's shields to adjust to all known weapons, even Starfleet's.#
CHAKOTAY: It must have scanned our weapons, adapted its shields.#
CHAKOTAY: To work, it would take more energy than all of our photons put together.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not leaving you on the ship.#
CHAKOTAY: Everyone except senior officers, with me.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, have you decided who's going to replace Paris?#
CHAKOTAY: They're made from a substance known as verterium cortenide. Do you know where we can find a source?#
CHAKOTAY: What initial investigation? Captain, what's going on?#
CHAKOTAY: Plan.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying Paris's insulting behaviour, the gambling, being late for duty, mouthing off at me, was all a ruse?#
CHAKOTAY: And the reason I wasn't let in on this little plan?#
CHAKOTAY: In other words, you didn't trust me.#
CHAKOTAY: Could it be Hogan?#
CHAKOTAY: That would put Neelix in a potentially dangerous situation.#
CHAKOTAY: This is the third time you've been late this week, Mister Paris.#
CHAKOTAY: What's the source?#
CHAKOTAY: Slow to half impulse.#
CHAKOTAY: She may be too sick.#
CHAKOTAY: It's about ten light years away. We should be in the general vicinity in about twenty two days.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: I wanted to talk to you about Lieutenant Paris. His attitude lately has been less than professional.#
CHAKOTAY: I know crew discipline's my responsibility, but in this case I thought I should let you get involved before I took any action. In a way, Paris has been your personal reclamation project.#
CHAKOTAY: How have you been feeling lately? Something bothering you?#
CHAKOTAY: Well, you've been moody lately, indifferent to your duties. To be honest, you don't seem to be taking your job very seriously. If you've got a problem, I'd like to know what it is.#
CHAKOTAY: You care to elaborate?#
CHAKOTAY: What's that supposed to mean?#
CHAKOTAY: Look, sometimes I'm not going to agree with your suggestions. But making decisions is part of being a leader. Maybe someday you'll understand that.#
CHAKOTAY: I didn't come here for a lecture from you on how to do my job.#
CHAKOTAY: Sure, Paris. You're excused. [Secret location] LORRUM#
CHAKOTAY: That's all right, Mister Paris. We don't need you. Mister Grimes has taken your place at conn.#
CHAKOTAY: Not today it isn't.#
CHAKOTAY: That's right.#
CHAKOTAY: When you decide to start taking your job seriously, we'll discuss it. But right now, you're dismissed.#
CHAKOTAY: You know, I didn't expect to be this nervous. It's not even my child.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain?#
CHAKOTAY: My father had a saying, Captain. Home is wherever you happen to be.#
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like we're headed right into their territory.#
CHAKOTAY: We have just barely enough.#
CHAKOTAY: Stand by. I'm having trouble with the alignment module.#
CHAKOTAY: I've got alignment. Magnetising the hull.#
CHAKOTAY: I think it worked.#
CHAKOTAY: The magnetic field is collapsing. The hull is depolarising!#
CHAKOTAY: Everybody out! Go, go, go! Hurry, Captain!#
CHAKOTAY: Captain!#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, let's go! (Note to#
CHAKOTAY: There are two Voyagers and two crews?#
CHAKOTAY: They may be able to do that, but we barely have enough power for life support. How can we get enough to send an energy pulse of that size?#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Can you identify them?#
CHAKOTAY: Still off-line. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY#
CHAKOTAY: Maybe they hit the other Voyager.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, the Vidiian ship has been destroyed. So has the other Voyager. Captain's log, stardate 49548.7. There are no signs of any pursuing Vidiian vessels, and we have resumed a course toward home.#
CHAKOTAY: According to Neelix, nobody's had direct contact with the Drayans for decades. All he's heard are rumours.#
CHAKOTAY: No, just very private.#
CHAKOTAY: I'd feel better about this particular twenty minutes if we had some idea what to expect.#
CHAKOTAY: I envied it so much I almost got myself shipped back to the academy for remedial training. On my first assignment we were sent to make contact with the Tarkannans. I studied all the information we had about them and pestered the Captain into letting me be part of the diplomatic team. When we came face to face with the Tarkannan delegation I very proudly made the traditional gesture for hello, not realising that males and females of their race use different styles of movement, and I was actually propositioning the Ambassador. [Transporter room]#
CHAKOTAY: Om-nah-hoo-pez-nyeetz. That's from the spirits of my people. It means, peace in your heart, fortune in your steps.#
CHAKOTAY: The reaction chamber is equipped with a compositor which allows us to re-crystallise the dilithium. In our situation we can never be sure when we'll be able to find a new supply.#
CHAKOTAY: Some human cultures have done the same. [Drayan moon] (Bennet has been moved out of sight into the shuttle.)#
CHAKOTAY: It shows.#
CHAKOTAY: We could assure her we have no intention of interfering with their culture or traditions.#
CHAKOTAY: Torres and Neelix just got back, but there's still no word from Tuvok and Bennet.#
CHAKOTAY: How many search parties could it take to find two crash victims?#
CHAKOTAY: What if they can't?#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, maybe you shouldn't#
CHAKOTAY: Looks like a glacial freeze.#
CHAKOTAY: Those glaciers are receding.#
CHAKOTAY: I thought you said there weren't any lifesigns.#
CHAKOTAY: Their timetable was supposed to end four years ago.#
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like we ought to get them out right away.#
CHAKOTAY: Why not?#
CHAKOTAY: If the only way to help those people is to go in and find out from them what's wrong, I don't see any alternative.#
CHAKOTAY: How do we negotiate without sending in another hostage?#
CHAKOTAY: Could we switch over to a simulated brain without the Clown noticing it?#
CHAKOTAY: How do the optronic pathways function in this system, B'Elanna?#
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. We're having some trouble with the transporter.#
CHAKOTAY: There's no evidence of any type of alien interference. Frankly, Captain, we're at a loss.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I recommend we programme a holodeck simulation. Try recreating the accident.#
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok said it could take up to ten days to check out all the possible problems. How'd you fix it so fast?#
CHAKOTAY: There's an old axiom. The whole is never greater than the sum of its parts. I think Tuvix might be disproving that notion. [Planet surface]#
CHAKOTAY: Best out of five?#
CHAKOTAY: Not at all.#
CHAKOTAY: Of course not.#
CHAKOTAY: I count myself as one of them.#
CHAKOTAY: Until the Captain makes a decision, Mister Tuvix is still the tactical officer.#
CHAKOTAY: What about keeping us in stasis aboard Voyager?#
CHAKOTAY: It's risky. The Vidiians have never shown any willingness to help us. It's more likely they'd attack Voyager and try to harvest body parts from the crew.#
CHAKOTAY: Could we live with ourselves, knowing we sent Voyager into that kind of danger?#
CHAKOTAY: It looks like they transported the contents of the whole ship.#
CHAKOTAY: Do you really think you can find a cure?#
CHAKOTAY: Does it matter which way these things go?#
CHAKOTAY: That's not much of a choice. Couldn't Starfleet have come up with something a little more cheerful?#
CHAKOTAY: I was thinking more of a tasteful pinstripe, something in blues and greens. Well, I suggest we put the grey on the outside and the beige inside.#
CHAKOTAY: Roughing it? Let's see, we have shelter, furniture, research equipment, tricorders, a replicator. It's too rough for me.#
CHAKOTAY: A bathtub?#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I'm sure you can learn to love the sonic shower.#
CHAKOTAY: Give me a few days on that one, okay?#
CHAKOTAY: Catch anything?#
CHAKOTAY: Oh, in the woods.#
CHAKOTAY: Not yet.#
CHAKOTAY: It means when it's time for you to know, I'll tell you.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm building something.#
CHAKOTAY: You can't stand it, can you? You're like a little kid wheedling.#
CHAKOTAY: Can't hurt to give it a try. [Outside the shelter] (There is a rustle in the nearby bushes. Janeway grabs a towel.)#
CHAKOTAY: I've detected primate life signs here, but I've never seen one.#
CHAKOTAY: Looking for a pet?#
CHAKOTAY: Well, excuse me.#
CHAKOTAY: Kathryn, the Doctor worked for weeks trying to find a treatment for this disease.#
CHAKOTAY: You've been at it twelve hours a day, seven days a week since we got here, and we're still no closer to a cure than we were the day we were infected.#
CHAKOTAY: My people have a saying. Even the eagle must know when to sleep. Maybe it's time we both considered that.#
CHAKOTAY: Why do you have to see it as defeat? Maybe it's simply accepting what life has dealt us, finding the good in it.#
CHAKOTAY: Making headboards.#
CHAKOTAY: I've noticed you sometimes sit up in your bed to read. I figured you might as well have a comfortable backrest.#
CHAKOTAY: But what I do makes you uncomfortable, doesn't it? Every time I do something that adds a personal touch to the shelter, you resist it.#
CHAKOTAY: I can't sacrifice the present waiting for a future that may never happen. The reality of this situation is that we may never leave here. So, yes, I'm trying to make a home. Something that's more than a plain, grey box.#
CHAKOTAY: Kathryn! Kathryn. Are you hurt?#
CHAKOTAY: Give it to me.#
CHAKOTAY: It seems to be some kind of plasma storm. Our tricorders don't recognise it, but it sure packs a wallop! [Ready room]#
CHAKOTAY: I'm sorry.#
CHAKOTAY: I've been thinking. There's plenty of wood available here. I could probably add rooms to the shelter, give us a little more living space.#
CHAKOTAY: I could do a certain amount with a phaser, but I was actually thinking of logs.#
CHAKOTAY: I built a few of them when I was growing up. My father thought it was important that I learn how.#
CHAKOTAY: No bathtub.#
CHAKOTAY: Well, maybe those camping trips helped prepare you for life here.#
CHAKOTAY: I think that's the first time I've heard you say anything positive about being here.#
CHAKOTAY: Do you expect him to answer you?#
CHAKOTAY: I doubt that he can be domesticated, at least not very easily.#
CHAKOTAY: That's a long time. At least I hope so.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Here, let me help.#
CHAKOTAY: I've had a lot of practice at this. My mother used to get sore necks all the time. I was the only one she'd trust not to make it worse.#
CHAKOTAY: Sleep well, Kathryn.#
CHAKOTAY: All right.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I can define parameters. But I can tell you a story, an ancient legend among my people. It's about an angry warrior who lived his life in conflict with the rest of his tribe, a man who couldn't find peace, even with the help of his spirit guide. For years, he struggled with his discontent. But the only satisfaction he ever got came when he was in battle. This made him a hero among his tribe, but the warrior still longed for peace within himself. One day he and his war party were captured by a neighbouring tribe led by a woman warrior. She called on him to join her because her tribe was too small and weak to defend itself from all its enemies. The woman warrior was brave and beautiful and very wise. The angry warrior swore to himself that he would stay by her side, doing whatever he could to make her burden lighter. From that point on, her needs would come first. And in that way, the warrior began to know the true meaning of peace.#
CHAKOTAY: No. But that made it easier to say.#
CHAKOTAY: How are they coming?#
CHAKOTAY: I would never have thought of you as a gardener.#
CHAKOTAY: Did you hate that as much as camping?#
CHAKOTAY: If your tomatoes could spare you for a minute, I'd like your opinion on something in the house.#
CHAKOTAY: Really?#
CHAKOTAY: What do you think?#
CHAKOTAY: You said you wanted to explore the river. I think I could build this.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure we could fit the bathtub in the boat.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes.#
CHAKOTAY: Ready?#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. I'll have a report to you by eighteen hundred hours.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, ma'am. I'll see to it.#
CHAKOTAY: I have a duty to this crew. I can't just leave and go looking for the child.#
CHAKOTAY: Do you think it's a trap?#
CHAKOTAY: On the other hand, it was time for her to deliver, and that baby we saw did look part Cardassian and part human.#
CHAKOTAY: Still, the safest thing would be to ignore this message and resume our course.#
CHAKOTAY: A-koo-chee-moya. We are far from the sacred places of our grandfathers. We are far from the bones of my people. But I ask, on this day of sorrow and uncertainty, that the wisdom of my father find me and help me understand my dilemma. Speak to me, Father. Speak to me in my dreams.#
CHAKOTAY: I have a son, Father.#
CHAKOTAY: Yes, but#
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I'm willing to be a father to him.#
CHAKOTAY: He was born without my consent. I had no part in it.#
CHAKOTAY: My DNA was taken from me, used by a woman to impregnate herself without my permission.#
CHAKOTAY: It's more than that.#
CHAKOTAY: How do you take a child into your heart who is forced upon you by a mother's deception?#
CHAKOTAY: No.#
CHAKOTAY: If these ships can fool the Kazon, it's worth it.#
CHAKOTAY: Uh, excuse me, but there is one more thing. Thank you.#
CHAKOTAY: I know this man. His name's Teirna. He's one of Seska's aides. She had him work me over when I was on their ship.#
CHAKOTAY: What about the child?#
CHAKOTAY: We'll be needing your help getting to the Gema system.#
CHAKOTAY: Under the circumstances, I'd say you don't have much of a choice. [Doctor's office] CHAKOTAY: Polycythemia?#
CHAKOTAY: I'd like you to run an autonomic response analysis the next time I question him.#
CHAKOTAY: Have you found anything at all that would cast doubt on his story?#
CHAKOTAY: I still don't trust him. [Briefing room]#
CHAKOTAY: We might have more success avoiding him if you gave us the command codes for the Nistrim defence net.#
CHAKOTAY: Feeling better?#
CHAKOTAY: You're still not optimistic about our chances, are you?#
CHAKOTAY: We've had no problem repelling the attacks so far.#
CHAKOTAY: You still have pride in the Nistrim, don't you, Teirna? Even after what they did to you. I remember that pride in your eyes when you pounded me with your fists while I was tied to a chair. And I can see it in your eyes now, and that scares the hell out of me.#
CHAKOTAY: Tell me something, Teirna. Every Kazon attack seems to focus on our starboard ventral. Think that might be some kind of pattern?#
CHAKOTAY: Because if it is, and you've been lying to us#
CHAKOTAY: Starboard ventral.#
CHAKOTAY: Stand down Red alert.#
CHAKOTAY: We barely have time to begin repairs before they attack it again.#
CHAKOTAY: Why would these factions of Kazon, loyal to no one, all have the same agenda? And why would that agenda focus on a nonessential area of the ship?#
CHAKOTAY: We can't just stay on this course and wait to see what they have in store for us.#
CHAKOTAY: Mister Teirna should be restricted to quarters on a secured deck until further notice.#
CHAKOTAY: Funny how they show up right after we reverse course.#
CHAKOTAY: They took the bait.#
CHAKOTAY: I like those odds better than eight to one.#
CHAKOTAY: Deck eight. Teirna's quarters.#
CHAKOTAY: Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Paris. Gamma sequence.#
CHAKOTAY: Navigational array is offline.#
CHAKOTAY: Intruder alert. Security to decks five through seven.#
CHAKOTAY: May he grow up never knowing the contempt his father has for his mother.#
CHAKOTAY: What?#
CHAKOTAY: Is that what she told you?#
CHAKOTAY: What's in the Hanon system?#
CHAKOTAY: A clearing with a protected side like the base of a cliff would be best.#
CHAKOTAY: That includes anything that can be used as a tool or a weapon.#
CHAKOTAY: All right, start dividing the crew. Looks like we don't have much daylight left. We'll spread the teams out in a standard alpha search pattern to see what we have to work with.#
CHAKOTAY: At first glance, it's an M-class planet in a Pliocene stage of evolution.#
CHAKOTAY: Let me help you.#
CHAKOTAY: Don't push yourself. That goes for everyone. Perspiring wastes water. (He takes the baby from her. There is a ground tremor. Captain Janeway leads them through a gap in the rocks.)#
CHAKOTAY: That's all that's left of Hogan's uniform, Captain. We didn't find anything else.#
CHAKOTAY: I know it sounds grisly, but I can make solar stills with the material from this uniform. We could have water tomorrow.#
CHAKOTAY: Trapped on a barren planet and you're stuck with the only Indian in the universe who can't start a fire by rubbing two sticks together. I was never good at this as a child and I'm still not good at it.#
CHAKOTAY: We need kindling of some sort.#
CHAKOTAY: Something my father once told me about starting a fire. (A short time later, all the long-haired crew have had to sacrifice a lock to the cause. Kim gets to cut Janeway's hair.)#
CHAKOTAY: Well, I'm better at tracking than starting fires.#
CHAKOTAY: This is thoughtful of you Tuvok, but my tribe never used bows and arrows, and I've never even shot one.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you all right?#
CHAKOTAY: Have you been able to tell if they have a leader?#
CHAKOTAY: Listen to the sound of my voice, and you'll know that I mean you no harm. I come without weapons. But I must have my people back.#
CHAKOTAY: Thank you, but she should stay with you. I must take them with me.#
CHAKOTAY: Kes, stand up slowly and walk away with us.#
CHAKOTAY: We have to go now.#
CHAKOTAY: Just keep walking. Don't look back.#
CHAKOTAY: In there!#
CHAKOTAY: I know. If they know it too, they won't follow us in. Come on!#
CHAKOTAY: Come on. We have to see if there's another way out of here.#
CHAKOTAY: All right, let's take it slow. Single file. [Outside the tunnel] (Torres, Ayala and a crewwoman throw rocks at the natives.)#
CHAKOTAY: Go!#
CHAKOTAY: Everybody out! [Outside the tunnel]#
CHAKOTAY: Go, go, go!#
CHAKOTAY: Come on. [Jefferies Tube] KAZON#
CHAKOTAY: I agree with the Captain. We have to find a way to share this world with them.#
CHAKOTAY: I don't believe that.#
CHAKOTAY: It's okay. (He puts her over his shoulder and carries her back up to safety. The chief is impressed.);#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, forgive me, but you've never been one to put much trust in religious ceremonies. Exactly what is it you hope to accomplish?#
CHAKOTAY: Some kind of physiological change, maybe.#
CHAKOTAY: We'll have to find a way to allow the Doctor to monitor your physical condition, and you should have a way to call for an emergency beam out if you need it. As a precaution. We don't have any idea what the ritual entails.#
CHAKOTAY: Of course there's always the possibility that the Ancestral Spirits really do control what happens in the shrine.#
CHAKOTAY: I remember when my mother taught me the science underlying the vision quest. In a way I felt disappointed. Some of the mystery was gone. Maybe the Nechani have chosen not to lose the mystery.#
CHAKOTAY: What does that mean? Is she in danger?#
CHAKOTAY: Then there's nothing so far that would suggest a treatment for Kes.#
CHAKOTAY: It's been three days since she had any sleep. How long are we going to let her go through this?#
CHAKOTAY: She's been poisoned by some unknown toxin. It may be having an effect we can't gauge. It could lie dormant for a few days and then suddenly fluctuate and kill her in minutes.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you getting enough meaningful information to justify her continuing this ordeal?#
CHAKOTAY: Then is it possible she's in no condition to activate the homing signal?#
CHAKOTAY: All right, we'll leave her there for now, but I'm not moving from this monitor until she gets back.#
CHAKOTAY: How does that translate into a cure for Kes?#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if you'll excuse me, I'm probably more useful on the bridge right now.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, we've been worried about you.#
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. I'll bring her down myself. Chakotay to sickbay. Doctor, prepare Kes for transport.#
CHAKOTAY: The Doctor says her life signs are deteriorating. He almost wouldn't let us take her out of sickbay.#
CHAKOTAY: You have some new information on the effects of the field?#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, you've been through a lot in the past few days.#
CHAKOTAY: Are you sure of that? There are eight hundred megajoules of biogenic energy running through that shrine. The thoron radiation levels are off the scale. That's what you'd be taking yourself and her into. Why don't you take some time to think about this and let us run a few more scans.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, this isn't like you.#
CHAKOTAY: He's right. It's my responsibility to keep you safe, for the crew's sake if not for your own. I'd rather not have to relieve you of duty, but if your judgment's been impaired in any way.#
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I don't understand this.#
CHAKOTAY: From the dispersal pattern of the interstellar plasma, it looks like it isn't fixed. Seems to be travelling through space.#
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Hard to believe, isn't it? (An older man in a long robe, and wearing a patch over his right eye, enters the square declaiming a poem.)#
CHAKOTAY: It was very nice.#
CHAKOTAY: I'm sorry. Not today.#
CHAKOTAY: We've really got to be going.#
CHAKOTAY: Tom?#
CHAKOTAY: I'm picking up a narrow band EM dampening field around that building. It looks like some sort of temple.#
CHAKOTAY: What do you mean, wearing your ears?#
CHAKOTAY: Must be some sort of fetish.#
CHAKOTAY: Greed is eternal.#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager.#
CHAKOTAY: We've found the replicator, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: What they've done is co-opt the local mythology by using advanced technology like the replicator to convince the people that they're the two Sages spoken of in the poem.#
CHAKOTAY: It's disgusting, Captain. The two Ferengi live in a palatial temple, while the people are lucky to have a roof over their heads.#
CHAKOTAY: Now that we've found them, what are we going to do with them?#
CHAKOTAY: But Arridor's right. We can't kidnap their gods either.#
CHAKOTAY: The gods would be gone, but the people would be prepared for it, and they might accept it as a natural ordained occurrence.#
CHAKOTAY: Let's get to the shuttle.#
CHAKOTAY: Your poem's very nice, but we're in a hurry.#
CHAKOTAY: Tell me something. What happens to the Sages at the end of the Song?#
CHAKOTAY: The Holy Pilgrim! The Holy Pilgrim! ;#
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager. On my mark.#
CHAKOTAY: Now.#
CHAKOTAY: Stand back.#
CHAKOTAY: We're all here in one piece, Captain.#
CHAKOTAY: Listen, friend, you're lucky to be alive. We beamed your shuttle to the shuttle bay. As for the rest of your possessions, they're back in the hands of the people you stole them from. Ensign Murphy, escort these men to secured quarters.#
CHAKOTAY: The gravitational effects of the wormhole are refracting the beam. I can't get a lock.#
CHAKOTAY: Try setting the scanners to a narrowband subspace frequency. [Ferengi shuttle] (An alarm sounds.)#
CHAKOTAY: Initiate a high intensity impulse burst.#
