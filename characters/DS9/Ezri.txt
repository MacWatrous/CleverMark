EZRI: That's all right, Mister Sisko, I'm not hungry. I'm here to see Ben.#
EZRI: Hello, Benjamin.#
EZRI: It's me. Dax.#
EZRI: Hello, Benjamin.#
EZRI: It's me. Dax.#
EZRI: I can hardly believe it myself. But I'm Dax. I mean, I'm not Jadzia Dax. I'm Ezri Dax. But I have all of Jadzia's memories. Not to mention Lela's, Tobin's, Emony's, Audrid's, Joran's, Curzon's. Am I forgetting anyone?#
EZRI: Right. You're probably asking yourself who is this person? How did she get the symbiont? Do I even want another Dax in my life? Does she always talk this much? These are all very good questions and I wish I had good answers for you.#
EZRI: Really? That is so nice of you to say. I'm not usually this emotional. It must be the Emony in me. At least I think it's Emony Hi, Jake.#
EZRI: You seem taller. Or am I shorter? You know, none of this was my idea. I never wanted to be joined.#
EZRI: It was an accident.#
EZRI: I was on the Destiny when they brought the Dax symbiont aboard to be taken back to Trill. Halfway through the trip, the symbiont took a turn for the worse and needed to be placed in a host immediately.#
EZRI: I laid down on that operating table one person and I woke up a completely different person. Well, I should say eight different people. I was not prepared for this at all. I mean, you're supposed to get years of training and preparation before you get joined, and all I got was a fifteen minute lecture from the ship's surgeon and he wasn't even a Trill.#
EZRI: You don't how much better I feel just being here with you, Ben.#
EZRI: I did meet with the Evaluation Board several times.#
EZRI: They gave me some books to read, some counselling, but once a host and symbiont are joined, there's really not very much they can do. My parents, my friends, my crewmates, it's like they don't even know me anymore. Which is understandable since I hardly even know myself. That's why I took a leave of absence to come here. I knew that if there is anyone who can help me through this, it would be you.#
EZRI: Fine. I'll come with you.#
EZRI: It doesn't matter. When do we leave?#
EZRI: Great. It'll be just like old times. Except different.#
EZRI: This is so embarrassing.#
EZRI: I'm a trained Starfleet officer. I've no business getting space sick. But ever since I was given the symbiont, warp speed does make me a little queasy.#
EZRI: No, I'm fine, really.#
EZRI: But I just wish I could stop thinking about Torias.#
EZRI: He died in a shuttle accident. I still remember the last few seconds before the crash. Maybe I don't belong in Starfleet anymore. Aren't you glad you brought me along?#
EZRI: One iced raktajino. I know you've been worried about your father, Jake, but he's going to be all right.#
EZRI: Because I've known him a long time. Besides, it's my job to know these things. I'm a ship's counsellor. Well, actually, an assistant ship's counsellor.#
EZRI: Is it that surprising?#
EZRI: You know, I wasn't always this confused. Before I was joined I was considered to be a very promising young officer. That is horrible. I hate raktajino.#
EZRI: Because Curzon liked it.#
EZRI: Well, I don't. I have to learn to control some of these urges.#
EZRI: There's too much ionisation in the atmosphere. It'll interfere with our sensors.#
EZRI: Hear what?#
EZRI: If there is an Orb buried around here, my tricorder's not picking it up.#
EZRI: Did they give you any hint which way to go?#
EZRI: I hope he heard them right.#
EZRI: Think we're getting close?#
EZRI: But we're headed in the right direction?#
EZRI: Audrid loved to walk. Of course, she preferred the woods. Nice shady glens, cool breezes, cold streams.#
EZRI: We've been keeping a pretty fast pace. It might be a good idea to give your father and Jake a chance to rest.#
EZRI: I think we should stick together.#
EZRI: Benjamin? Benjamin. Is this it?#
EZRI: You're not sure? Ben, that's not good enough. Ben.#
EZRI: Are you listening to me?#
EZRI: Where?#
EZRI: Why there? I wasn't even aiming at anything. Ben, maybe my memories are playing tricks on me but have you gotten stranger?#
EZRI: Here.#
EZRI: Who?#
EZRI: You have definitely gotten stranger.#
EZRI: What are you going to do?#
EZRI: Benjamin what's wrong? Benjamin.#
EZRI: Benjamin, what are you waiting for? Open it. That's why we're here, right?#
EZRI: Jake! Jake, are you all right?#
EZRI: Ben?#
EZRI: Ben, what are you doing?#
EZRI: Ben, stop.#
EZRI: No!#
EZRI: Ben, you came here to find the Prophets, remember?#
EZRI: No, listen to me. You promised Jadzia you would make things right. Well now is your chance. Open the box, Ben.#
EZRI: Benjamin? That must have been some Orb experience.#
EZRI: Odo! Nerys! Julian! It's so good to see you. Worf, we need to talk.#
EZRI: It's funny. Before yesterday, I'd never set foot on this station but it's as familiar to me as the back of my hand. Isn't that odd?#
EZRI: You have no idea who I am, do you?#
EZRI: I didn't think so. Thanks for listening anyway..#
EZRI: I was killed here. I mean, Jadzia was.#
EZRI: It's a strange sensation, dying. No matter how many times it happens to you, you never get used to it. It must be a little disconcerting for you, knowing that I have Jadzia's memories. No wonder you're uncomfortable.#
EZRI: Tell me about it. Well, I'll let you get to your prayers.#
EZRI: Bloodwine.#
EZRI: It smells awful.#
EZRI: I used to be right handed, too. A lot of things have changed since I was joined.#
EZRI: Who knows anymore?#
EZRI: I'm not staying. I'm going back to the Destiny to be an assistant counsellor.#
EZRI: Why does everyone sound so surprised when they hear that?#
EZRI: I don't want to force things. People need time to get over losing Jadzia. You know something, Quark? Besides Benjamin, you're the only one of Jadzia's friends who doesn't seem uncomfortable around me.#
EZRI: Who could forget? Wait a minute. You owe me ten slips of latinum from our last game.#
EZRI: I won with a Full Consortium. I remember.#
EZRI: Don't say that, Quark. I'm confused enough as it is.#
EZRI: Are you alone?#
EZRI: I didn't want to go through Ops in case Worf was there. We bumped into each other last night in Quark's.#
EZRI: Of course not. But he wouldn't even talk to me.#
EZRI: But that doesn't mean we can't talk to each other. Worf knows that.#
EZRI: I told him all about Trill traditions. Jadzia did. We discussed them. They discussed them.#
EZRI: These pronouns are going to drive me crazy.#
EZRI: Look at him, Benjamin. He's in pain.#
EZRI: I was his wife. I can tell. I don't want to put him through any more heartache than he's already going through. It's a good thing I'm going back to the Destiny.#
EZRI: I can't stay. I couldn't do that to him. Besides, I think it might be easier for me on the Destiny. There are too many memories here.#
EZRI: I'm going to miss you too, Benjamin.#
EZRI: Me? You want me to work with Garak?#
EZRI: Assistant counsellor. I'm still in training.#
EZRI: Oh, how to keep from breaking into tears for no reason. How to resist the urge to stand on my head. Things like that.#
EZRI: Emony used to do it.#
EZRI: She found it relaxing.#
EZRI: Actually, it's giving me a headache.#
EZRI: Why can't Julian work with Garak?#
EZRI: I bet he doesn't stand on his head for no reason, either.#
EZRI: All right, I'll try. I just wish I had as much confidence in me as you do.#
EZRI: Am I interrupting?#
EZRI: Is that all right?#
EZRI: I understand. So is it helping? The sewing. Is it making you feel better?#
EZRI: You're lucky, nothing helps me.#
EZRI: Why would you say that?#
EZRI: No, I get spacesick. Ever since I was joined. I'm very sensitive to motion. I can even feel the station spinning.#
EZRI: It's because of what happened to Torias. He was killed in a shuttle accident.#
EZRI: Because I blame myself for what happened.#
EZRI: Yes. No. Depends on how you look at it. Torias was my fifth host. Didn't I say that?#
EZRI: Well, he was. And I think the reason that his death has stayed with me for so long is because I just can't seem to forgive him for getting himself killed.#
EZRI: I know. But somehow I can't help but punish myself for it.#
EZRI: Exactly.#
EZRI: You're probably right. But I didn't come here to talk about myself, I came to talk about you.#
EZRI: Do you remember anything traumatic happening to you when you were young. Something involving getting trapped in a confined space.#
EZRI: Sounds like he was strict.#
EZRI: Did he discipline you?#
EZRI: Tobin.#
EZRI: Why didn't you mention that when I asked if you'd ever been trapped in a confined space.#
EZRI: Learned your lesson? Did you think you deserved to be locked in that closet?#
EZRI: You blame yourself. Just like I blame myself for that shuttle accident. Maybe you get claustrophobic for the same reason that I get spacesick. We're both punishing ourselves for things that weren't our fault. That's it. Don't you see? We both have to let go of all this misplaced guilt.#
EZRI: Not overnight, but it's a step in the right direction.#
EZRI: Me too. Are you all right?#
EZRI: Probably because we've been talking about it. Actually, I'm starting to feel a little spacesick myself.#
EZRI: Good idea.#
EZRI: My pleasure.#
EZRI: Hello, Worf.#
EZRI: Ensign? That's all you have to say to me?#
EZRI: I was your wife.#
EZRI: Come in.#
EZRI: Do you think the Chief could adjust the inertial dampers so the station would spin a little slower?#
EZRI: Never mind. To what do I owe the pleasure?#
EZRI: Really?#
EZRI: I guess our talk helped him.#
EZRI: I thought you said you weren't going to say that.#
EZRI: I talked with Worf. He doesn't want to have anything to do with me.#
EZRI: Absolutely not. You intimidate him.#
EZRI: Don't tell him I told you.#
EZRI: You like that, don't you?#
EZRI: Come on. I've been a man, I know.#
EZRI: What are you getting at, Benjamin?#
EZRI: Thanks for saying that. But even if Worf wasn't an issue, I'm still just an assistant counsellor.#
EZRI: How'd you talk them into that?#
EZRI: That I haven't already learned in the last three hundred years.#
EZRI: It means a lot to me that you want me to stay, but I can't.#
EZRI: Mostly.#
EZRI: Idanian spice pudding. No, cancel that. I'll have a kilm steak, rare. No, Tobin was a vegetarian. Give me#
EZRI: How'd you know?#
EZRI: Sure.#
EZRI: What was that?#
EZRI: That look.#
EZRI: Don't flirt with me, Julian. Please.#
EZRI: I remember the way you used to flirt with Jadzia.#
EZRI: Good. Because I'm not like her. She knew how to handle it. Actually, she quite enjoyed it.#
EZRI: You didn't know?#
EZRI: You can be very charming. You want to know something? If Worf hadn't come along, it would have been you.#
EZRI: You really miss her, don't you?#
EZRI: Garak, open the door.#
EZRI: Breathe in, and out. In and out. Better? It's beautiful, isn't it? Look at that sky. It just goes on and on.#
EZRI: But you can't see it.#
EZRI: We could call up another programme.#
EZRI: If you were looking for fresh air, you sure were knocking on the wrong door.#
EZRI: You're not going to have to leave the station. I'll talk to Quark and tell him to leave this holosuite available to you twenty six hours a day. So the next time you feel like jumping out the nearest airlock, come here instead. It's going to be all right. We're going to get this under control. I promise.#
EZRI: I'll come and check in on you later.#
EZRI: Garak? I thought you were going to stay in the holosuite for a while.#
EZRI: And if you didn't? What would he do to you?#
EZRI: I'd like to try.#
EZRI: What does it look like? I'm resigning from Starfleet.#
EZRI: Because I can't do my job. Garak was right. How can I help other people when I can't even help myself?#
EZRI: Don't call me that! I'm not the old man. I'm not Curzon. Or Jadzia.#
EZRI: It's a gift I don't deserve.#
EZRI: I wish they could. But removing the symbiont would kill me, you know that.#
EZRI: Stop it, Benjamin. I thought you of all people would understand.#
EZRI: I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I wish I'd been able to help you.#
EZRI: Well, you don't have to worry about me bothering you anymore. I'll be leaving in the morning.#
EZRI: They're putting in for supplies before they head to the front. But I won't be going with them. I've decided to go back to Trill.#
EZRI: Actually, the Destiny's going to be joining the Seventh Fleet at Kalandra.#
EZRI: Those transmissions you decoded last week must have convinced Starfleet that it's a good place to launch a new offensive.#
EZRI: If the offensive goes well, Starfleet will have you to thank for it.#
EZRI: I just thought you should know.#
EZRI: Are you all right?#
EZRI: Let's just hope it goes well. The Cardassians will put up a strong fight.#
EZRI: How can you be so sure?#
EZRI: I suppose that's one way of looking at it.#
EZRI: That by helping to end the war, you'll be saving lives.#
EZRI: And Cardassian.#
EZRI: Dax to Infirmary, I need a medical team.#
EZRI: How are you feeling?#
EZRI: At least we found out what's been triggering these claustrophobic attacks you've been having.#
EZRI: Now that you know that, what are you going to do?#
EZRI: The Captain will be glad to hear that you're back on the job.#
EZRI: No. I'm going to stay in Starfleet.#
EZRI: The Captain!#
EZRI: It's my request to be reinstated into Starfleet.#
EZRI: Why not?#
EZRI: I had a feeling you didn't mean all those things you said to me. You were just trying to rattle my cage.#
EZRI: Thanks. Somehow I thought you'd be happier that I was staying in Starfleet.#
EZRI: Me, too. But you know I can't.#
EZRI: Yes?#
EZRI: Of course.#
EZRI: That's right.#
EZRI: You'll get no argument from me there.#
EZRI: And she loved you.#
EZRI: I know.#
EZRI: Worf, I can't stay. I couldn't do that to you.#
EZRI: Very much.#
EZRI: Thank you.#
EZRI: You need your breathing room. I understand.#
EZRI: I don't want to put you out.#
EZRI: I'll be there.#
EZRI: Thanks, Quark. Worf isn't here, is he?#
EZRI: I hope it isn't too crowded for you.#
EZRI: You're not going to get much of an argument from this group.#
EZRI:  Right. Chief, what's a grand slam?#
EZRI: Right, except it's bases loaded. Now, what's a Fancy Dan?#
EZRI: I most certainly am not.#
EZRI: You should come watch.#
EZRI: That is so sweet.#
EZRI: You almost had it.#
EZRI:  I can't believe this. I used to be an athlete. At least I remember being an athlete. My third host Emony was an Olympic gymnast. I keep expecting my legs to react like hers did, but I fell all over myself. It's like I don't know my own body anymore.#
EZRI: If you believe Julian. Personally, I'm not sure I'm going to make it.#
EZRI: Benjamin was way out of line today, Rom.#
EZRI: I got it!#
EZRI: That was yours all the way! Oh, come on, Julian!#
EZRI: Curzon and Jadzia always wondered why Benjamin hated Solok but he'd never talk about it.#
EZRI: Yeah.#
EZRI: Rom, you did it!#
EZRI: Are you always this emotional?#
EZRI: Human? Did I forget to wear my spots today?#
EZRI: I know you're disappointed, Julian, but you did everything that you could.#
EZRI: I'm sorry. Obviously you want to punish yourself. Do you want help? Because I'm really good at punishing myself. Let's see. If I were you, I'd be kicking myself for making promises I couldn't keep. For getting people's hopes up. For being arrogant enough to think that I could help Sarina even though dozens of other doctors have failed. Should I keep going?#
EZRI: Glad I could help. What is it?#
EZRI: What is it?#
EZRI: What's causing it?#
EZRI: There they are.#
EZRI: Because they're men. And men have trouble expressing their feelings.#
EZRI: Julian, let's sit down.#
EZRI: Do you have any idea what's wrong?#
EZRI: I'd make myself scarce if I were you.#
EZRI: I tried to warn you.#
EZRI: How could I forget that? That is one of Curzon's favourite memories. Hi.#
EZRI: I am on duty. I'll see you later. It's good to see you again, Kor.#
EZRI: The usual. I have the same conversation over and over again. Everyone's shocked at first, then they start scanning my face for signs of the person they knew as Dax. It can't be. Is it really you? Oh, I do see a little Jadzia in the eyes, a little Curzon in the smile.#
EZRI: You're right. The last five Dax hosts went through this. That wasn't bad. You'd make a pretty good counsellor. You want to trade jobs?#
EZRI: Funny you should mention dreams. Ever since my conversation with Kor, I've had the most intense dreams about him.#
EZRI: Being on a Klingon bridge together, going off into battle, drinking bloodwine, which still makes me gag by the way, singing songs. A part of me wants to be out there with him now. I hope he's all right. I mean, I know I'm sort of contradicting what I just said about wanting to set myself apart from my previous hosts, but the memories I have of being with him are so vivid, I can't bear the thought of losing him. I'd give almost anything for the chance to be together one more time. The two of us, side by side, just like it used to be.#
EZRI: So, what's your professional opinion?#
EZRI: Next patient!#
EZRI: Hi. I think I'm in the mood for#
EZRI: Okay.#
EZRI: Excuse me?#
EZRI: Can I say something now? I'm not interested in having another relationship with Worf. I care about him and I probably always will, but he's moved on with his life and so have I.#
EZRI: And I'd also like to say that what you just did was one of the kindest, dearest and for you, one of the most embarrassing things that I have ever heard.  You're a real sweetheart. Can I order now? A Moscow mule.#
EZRI: Quark, you're mumbling again.#
EZRI: But the Grand Nagus picked you for this assignment.#
EZRI: Maybe he wants to hear things from a Ferengi perspective.#
EZRI: The Nagus trusts you.#
EZRI: It's my job. Remember the thirty fourth Rule of Acquisition. War is good for business.#
EZRI: Stay here.#
EZRI: Nog, your uncle's just a little nervous. He's not used to being in a combat situation.#
EZRI: Your frequency discriminator seems to be drifting. You might want to reset it.#
EZRI: No, but Tobin, one of my previous hosts, was.#
EZRI: Does that mean we stop working on the communications array?#
EZRI: I'm all for that. These mines are a nasty piece of engineering.#
EZRI: He's just being modest, Captain. Chief O'Brien would be proud to have him on his crew.#
EZRI: Now we get to pull a rabbit out of our hat.#
EZRI: Actually, I'm not sure it was me. It could've been Tobin or Jadzia.#
EZRI: Unfortunately, I can't extend its range past a hundred metres.#
EZRI: Maybe we should try cross linking the optronic and isodyne relays.#
EZRI: In nine lives I've been a little of everything.#
EZRI: You have no idea.#
EZRI: I'll give you an example. This is my first time on the front lines.#
EZRI: Right. But Torias, Curzon, and Jadzia, they were in battle many times, and I can remember what that felt like. I remember the fear, and the anger, and the adrenaline surge.#
EZRI: I suppose I'm going to find out.#
EZRI: Benjamin, sorry to interrupt. We're ready.#
EZRI: It's not that. It's just that a few hours ago, we thought of these mines as the kind of ruthless weapon only the Dominion would use. But now#
EZRI: I didn't hear anything.#
EZRI: Shh. Listen.#
EZRI: Your idea?#
EZRI: How's Nog?#
EZRI: Put it this way, I wouldn't go for a stroll through that ravine tonight.#
EZRI: Kellin? Kellin?#
EZRI: A Til'amin froth for me.#
EZRI: What was it about?#
EZRI: That's so sweet.#
EZRI: Would it bother you if Odo believed in Klingon religion?#
EZRI: And go to Sto'Vo'Kor when he dies.#
EZRI: That really is so sweet.#
EZRI: Like what?#
EZRI: I think he's probably expecting a few questions.#
EZRI: Why?#
EZRI: That's right. And you should both just relax. Yes, Nog has lost a leg and that's a traumatic experience, but nothing you do or say or do is going to be worse than what he's already gone through. Just be happy to see him and tell him you love him. For today, that'll be enough.#
EZRI: Welcome back.#
EZRI: Absolutely. We can celebrate once you've settled in.#
EZRI: And Julian and Miles have become even more obsessed with their Alamo programme, if you can believe it. I half expect Miles to start wearing a coonskin cap to work. You see, Davy Crockett wore this cap made of a raccoon skin and#
EZRI: Oh. Well, I think we've covered just about everything you missed while you were away. Is there anything you want to talk about?#
EZRI: What?#
EZRI: He didn't say that.#
EZRI: Forget what he thinks. What do you think? Why do you need the cane?#
EZRI: Sounds reasonable to me.#
EZRI: I understand. I think we've done enough for today. I'll see you tomorrow.#
EZRI: And his counselling sessions have been going nowhere. In his words, he's sick of talking about his feelings. I can't say I blame him. He's been under constant psychiatric care for almost two months now.#
EZRI: I'm not sure. For now, I think our best bet is to simply watch and wait.#
EZRI: I know. But sometimes a patient can help guide his own treatment. Let's see what Nog does next.#
EZRI: Rom.#
EZRI: He is not crazy.#
EZRI: At first, it struck me as a little peculiar. But after I thought it over, I began to think that this might be a good sign after all.#
EZRI: No, I'm not sure. But I think Nog might be subconsciously trying to seek out his own form of therapy.#
EZRI: Okay, it sounds a little odd.#
EZRI: I think we should wait and see how this plays out.#
EZRI: I'll do it.#
EZRI: Great. Do you have any questions?#
EZRI: I'm positive. It's a psychological need, not a physical one.#
EZRI: Okay, but don't push it.#
EZRI: No. Well, you know how to reach me if you have any problems.#
EZRI: Hi. Where's Nog?#
EZRI: I need to talk to him.#
EZRI: I'm afraid not.#
EZRI: No. But I do think that it's time for Nog to leave the holosuite.#
EZRI: Vic, he can't hide in here forever. He has to face reality sometime.#
EZRI: No offence, but you're just a hologram and I am his counsellor. I outrank you and I feel that it's time for him to go.#
EZRI: How do you know that?#
EZRI: Wait a minute. Let's slow down here. No one's talking about forcing anyone to do anything.#
EZRI: Nog, this is a holosuite.#
EZRI: Of course I am. I got to hand it to you, Vic, you've done a great job with him. He seems like a new man.#
EZRI: Heals all wounds, right? Giving him that cane was a great idea. I haven't seen him limp in days.#
EZRI: No kidding.#
EZRI: So, what's next for you two?#
EZRI: Sammy's a friend of yours?#
EZRI: I see. You're going to get Sammy convince him that it's time to leave the holosuite?#
EZRI: Forget it. I should know better by now than to ask you to give away your secrets. You probably have the whole thing all mapped out. I mean, what am I thinking? That this new casino is anything more than a ploy? That you'd actually let him live out the rest of his life in a holosuite?#
EZRI: They'll be so glad to have him back.#
EZRI: It's like you said. He just needed a break from reality. Now all that's left is to decide when he's ready to go back. But I'll leave that up to you. See you around.#
EZRI: My what? Oh, no.#
EZRI: Jadzia ordered it. She was planning a party for Martok's birthday next week.#
EZRI: Each containing a different variety.#
EZRI: Oh, yes. I can remember what each one tastes like, and the way they feel when you swallow them. Torgud gagh wiggles. Filden gagh squirms. Meshta gagh jumps.#
EZRI: Bithool gagh has feet. Flush it out the airlock. All of it.#
EZRI: He'd insist on sharing it with me as a point of honour. Wistan gagh is packed in targ blood. I have to go now. See you later.#
EZRI: I'm sure they do. My mother's one of the more important business leaders in the system.#
EZRI: Actually, it's the sixth now. The Ferengi discovered a large deposit on Timor Two a few years ago. My mother nearly had a heart attack when she found out we'd been knocked out of the top five.#
EZRI: Oh, I'm sure she would.#
EZRI: No. Yes. I don't know. I haven't talked to my mother in almost six months.#
EZRI: The last time I saw her was just after I was joined. She came to visit me on Trill and I was still a little confused. When she walked into my room, I put on a big smile, looked her straight in the eye and said, 'Hi, Mom, it's me, Curzon. Things kinda went downhill from there.#
EZRI: She didn't. Not really. But she did want me to come home to recuperate, and we had a disagreement.#
EZRI: No, not for the first time.#
EZRI: No, that's all right. I mean, my family problems aren't as important as finding the Chief. I'll call my mother right away.#
EZRI: Anytime.#
EZRI: I'm all right. Really. And I'm a lot more sure of who I am than the last time you saw me.#
EZRI: I've been promoted.#
EZRI: Lieutenant junior grade Ezri Dax at your service.#
EZRI: The symbiont name always replaces the family name of the new host. It's traditional.#
EZRI: Mother, I'm calling because I need your help. One of our officers, Miles O'Brien, went to New Sydney three weeks ago and now he's missing. Captain Sisko was wondering if maybe you could#
EZRI: Thank you.#
EZRI: I'm not sure when I can get away.#
EZRI: I know, but with the war on and everything#
EZRI: Mother, no. Please don't put me in this#
EZRI: So will the other passengers.#
EZRI: Where's your report?#
EZRI: Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be out of the doghouse by the time I get back.#
EZRI: I'm about to present my family with a whole new Ezri. And to tell you the truth, they didn't really know what to make of the old one. But thanks for trying, Julian. I'll let you know as soon as I find out anything about Miles.#
EZRI: Norvo.#
EZRI: Neither can I.#
EZRI: Oh, yeah. It kept getting in my eyes. Do you like it?#
EZRI: I think you've just summed up my entire visit. Is this yours?#
EZRI: Why?#
EZRI: But other than that#
EZRI: Hi, Janel.#
EZRI: It's good to see you.#
EZRI: Have they found out anything?#
EZRI: Of course I appreciate it.#
EZRI: I'm not sure yet.#
EZRI: We're in the middle of a war, Janel. I have responsibilities back on DS Nine.#
EZRI: Hello, Mother.#
EZRI: No, not yet.#
EZRI: Jadzia considered Kira one of her best friends, and I'm starting to think of her the same way. We spend a lot of time together.#
EZRI: Well, no more than anyone else. I don't really think any of them were expecting another Dax to walk into their lives.#
EZRI: Brinner Finok.#
EZRI: He was an Ensign. I did talk to him after I was joined, once. I don't think we're really right for each other anymore. He reminds me too much of my son Gran. It makes me a little uncomfortable being around him now. Sorry. Audrid's son Gran. I'm still sorting out my pronouns.#
EZRI: No, just me. Nothing simple for Ezri. There's times when the computer asks me to identify myself and I have to think about what to say. Or worse yet, there're days when I wake up and I don't even know if I'm a man or a woman until I pull back the covers. I also have an unfortunate tendency to ramble.#
EZRI: It can be a little overwhelming at times.#
EZRI: That's nice to know. But I think I've got things under control now.#
EZRI: How'd you know it was me?#
EZRI: Hmm. I see some things never change.#
EZRI: How many of these are yours?#
EZRI: When did you become such a harsh critic of your work?#
EZRI: Sure.#
EZRI: I don't care. Norvo, this doesn't mean that#
EZRI: All right. The Andorian Academy rejected your application. That doesn't mean your work is amateurish. There are other art schools.#
EZRI: So? You shouldn't just quit.#
EZRI: Those are Mother's words. I know because I've heard them too. She wasn't right about me and she's not right about you, either.#
EZRI: To do what, the family bookkeeping? Norvo, you could do so much more. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I just want you to know that I still believe in you.#
EZRI: Good night.#
EZRI: No.#
EZRI: I think it's funny you think he did this because of me. He's not happy here, Mother. Can't you see that?#
EZRI: Mother, he's defacing his own artwork. Work that you insisted on displaying even after he objected.#
EZRI: But what you've done is made him feel trapped and powerless.#
EZRI: He is a grown man who needs his freedom. You're smothering him.#
EZRI: Actually I have three, no, four lifetimes worth of memories about raising children.#
EZRI: Miles!#
EZRI: This is my home. This is where I live. My mother.#
EZRI: Did you do this to him?#
EZRI: Did you find anything on Bilby's wife?#
EZRI: Do you have any idea of cause of death?#
EZRI: Why?#
EZRI: I'm sorry, Chief. I wish there was something more I could do.#
EZRI: It may take a lot of good words, but I'll talk to him.#
EZRI: Now? Mother, he needs some rest.#
EZRI: I'm sorry about this. Our mother's a force of nature.#
EZRI: Good afternoon.#
EZRI: Don't worry. You're out of the line of fire for the moment. She's too busy torturing Janel and Miles.#
EZRI: He's fine.#
EZRI: Not right away. Let's talk about you. More specifically, about what you did last night.#
EZRI: Do you regret what you did?#
EZRI: So, what are you feeling?#
EZRI: Sorry. It's what I do.#
EZRI: All right, Doctor Norvo. If that's your diagnosis, what's your prescription?#
EZRI: Not funny.#
EZRI: Norvo, what would happen if you left with me tomorrow?#
EZRI: I mean, what would happen if you went back to Deep Space Nine with me?#
EZRI: Forget about her for the moment.#
EZRI: Well, it doesn't have to be a permanent move. Think of it as a vacation, a break from all of this. Some time to clear your head, that's all.#
EZRI: Janel can handle it.#
EZRI: Like what?#
EZRI: No offence, Norvo, but you're not exactly holding the company together. Mother can pay a real accountant to do the work she's given you.#
EZRI: Well think about it.#
EZRI: Oh, don't mind him. He's been under a lot of pressure.#
EZRI: No. But I make it a point to know as little as possible about the family business. Why?#
EZRI: You think this Mister Bokar is a member of the Syndicate?#
EZRI: We should tell Janel.#
EZRI: Janel is not someone who is easily intimidated. And my mother? She would burn this place to the ground before she did business with the Syndicate.#
EZRI: Now I remember why I never went into the family business. All these contracts and invoices, balance sheets and shipping orders. I feel like I'm trapped in some kind of Ferengi nightmare. What? What is it?#
EZRI: What do you mean?#
EZRI: I don't know what you're talking about, so maybe you should just tell me, Chief.#
EZRI: No. Of course not.#
EZRI: Are you suggesting#
EZRI: Five bars of latinum a week for services rendered. What services? There's no cross reference. No indication of what she was doing for the company.#
EZRI: The last payment entry was six weeks ago.#
EZRI: My mother, ultimately. But she's turned over most of the day to day operations to Janel, and Norvo's been doing the bookkeeping. Any one of them could know about Morica's payments. Or all of them.#
EZRI: Not yet. Not until I find out what's happened. That's an order.#
EZRI: So you turned to the Syndicate?#
EZRI: What about Morica?#
EZRI: All right! All right! We can talk about who saved what later. Right now, we have to concentrate on what happened to Morica. The payroll records show a steady increase in her payments. Why?#
EZRI: How did she die?#
EZRI: Norvo, you don't know what happened to Morica, do you?#
EZRI: Tell me you don't know anything about this.#
EZRI: Janel, forget about the mine. It doesn't matter. I want you to listen to me. After Norvo's trial is over, you need to go.#
EZRI: It doesn't matter. Just go. Find another life for yourself. Trust me. You'll be happier.#
EZRI: They've taken Norvo. I'm going to stay on New Sydney for the trial and then I'm going to head back to Deep Space Nine.#
EZRI: Last night. Norvo was sentenced to thirty years.#
EZRI: I understand why you feel that way. But you didn't know him, Miles. Norvo was very gifted. When we were young he had so much potential. Norvo was always the one that we all thought would be something special. And I don't know what happened. I don't know how my brother turned into. You know, I guess I just spent so many years dreaming of ways to get out of that house that I didn't see what was really going on inside, what was happening to Norvo. The endless humiliation, the constant drumbeat of criticism, the way his heart was carved up into little pieces. I should have seen it. I should have tried to stop it.#
EZRI: But I am, don't you see? I should have gone home a long time ago.#
EZRI: Anyone else here?#
EZRI: Is that the bedroom?#
EZRI: I don't know what you think is going on here, but think again.#
EZRI: I hope not.#
EZRI: My name's not Dax.#
EZRI: Shmun?#
EZRI: You're a very confused man, aren't you? If your friend Zek is depending on you, he's in a lot more trouble than he thinks.#
EZRI: I'll let him explain.#
EZRI: You're catching on.#
EZRI: The Regent wants the cloaking device in three days.#
EZRI: You'll find a way.#
EZRI: The Nagus will die.#
EZRI: As soon as I bring that to the Regent, he'll release Zek.#
EZRI: Then you get him back. Would you stop doing that?#
EZRI: Staring at me.#
EZRI: Do I have to throw you off this transport pad?#
EZRI: You don't. But there's not much you can do about it, is there?#
EZRI: I don't think you'll like it too much on the other side.#
EZRI: Yes it did. We're on Terok Nor.#
EZRI: We'd better get moving. I've got a ship waiting for us at landing pad C.#
EZRI: This is a rebel base and we're working for the Alliance.#
EZRI: Do as he says.#
EZRI: I'm not a traitor.#
EZRI: I believe in getting paid for my work, and you still owe me for the last job I did for you.#
EZRI: Like you said, you have to have something to believe in.#
EZRI: I'll live.#
EZRI: Don't worry about me. Smiley's right about one thing. If you're found in Alliance territory without the cloaking device, you're dead.#
EZRI: It's the smart move.#
EZRI: And then?#
EZRI: All right. Let's say you manage to save this Grand Nagus of yours. Then what?#
EZRI: That's it?#
EZRI: Quark, don't play dumb with me. You're risking your life for him. There has to be a reason for it.#
EZRI: In other words, he's rich.#
EZRI: I see. How much are you expecting to get out of him?#
EZRI: I don't understand.#
EZRI: Why?#
EZRI: You're kidding me, right? You're doing this out of loyalty?#
EZRI: I hope so.#
EZRI: This should be good.#
EZRI: What took you so long?#
EZRI: Okay. Quit your complaining and get us out of here.#
EZRI: Brunt modified the dilithium matrix to maximise the output.#
EZRI: He's a very good engineer.#
EZRI: It has been a long day.#
EZRI: We're not due to rendezvous with the Regent's ship for another forty six hours.#
EZRI: By bringing him the cloaking device, you've proven yourself useful. Believe me, the Regent never gets rid of anyone he finds useful.#
EZRI: What can I say? I'm loyal to my friends.#
EZRI: Forget about them, all right?#
EZRI: Don't tell me who I like.#
EZRI: Forget it, Brunt.#
EZRI: No!#
EZRI: It's your mess. You clean it up.#
EZRI: One of the Ferengi seemed to know how it worked.#
EZRI: I'll get him.#
EZRI: Good. Lower the forcefield.#
EZRI: I'm trying to save your lives.#
EZRI: All right, forget it.#
EZRI: Where do you think you're going?#
EZRI: You're a bartender, Quark. What are you going to do? Mix him a drink?#
EZRI: I don't expect you to believe this, but I am trying to help you.#
EZRI: Well done.#
EZRI: I'm not doing this for money.#
EZRI: Do you want to get out of here or not?#
EZRI: Then stop asking questions and let's go.#
EZRI: Here I am.#
EZRI: I was about to ask you the same question.#
EZRI: You go. I'm staying here.#
EZRI: You shouldn't have killed Brunt.#
EZRI: I hope not.#
EZRI: I owe her that much.#
EZRI: In that case, I won't bother saying goodbye.#
EZRI: I'm not going anywhere.#
EZRI: I don't think that's such a good idea.#
EZRI: I think I can take it from here.#
EZRI: Must be my lucky day.#
EZRI: Now, now. Modesty above all.#
EZRI: I know when I'm not wanted.#
EZRI: I'll take him. His quarters are on my way.#
EZRI: He won't be the first drunken Ensign I've escorted home. Someday remind me to tell you about a bar on Bolarus and a certain young Mister Sisko. This way.#
EZRI: Kind of sneaks up on you, doesn't it?#
EZRI: Are you all right? Do you want some raktajino?#
EZRI: I should get going. Make sure you get some sleep.#
EZRI: And you're very drunk.#
EZRI: Good night, Ilario.#
EZRI: Yeah, yeah. I'm up.#
EZRI: Fanalian tea. Hot.#
EZRI: What happened?#
EZRI: Killed? How?#
EZRI: What was the time of death?#
EZRI: That's only ten minutes after I left.#
EZRI: I didn't see anyone, but I wasn't here for very long.#
EZRI: As far as I could tell, he was intelligent, dedicated, eager to please. Everyone liked him.#
EZRI: Don't look at me. We never discussed his family. Mostly he talked about the Academy and about the two of you.#
EZRI: He really admired both of you.#
EZRI: I just wish I hadn't left his quarters so quickly. Maybe he'd still be alive.#
EZRI: Odo will catch whoever did this, won't he?#
EZRI: Shouldn't you be in bed?#
EZRI: I just couldn't sleep.#
EZRI: I don't, not really.#
EZRI: It's just knowing that he was murdered.#
EZRI: Not to me.#
EZRI: Meaning that I know exactly what it feels like. To feel the urge, the need, to take a life.#
EZRI: He killed three people. He was a host to the Dax symbiont, just like me.#
EZRI: I try not to think about it. Jadzia felt the same way. She tried to bury his memories as deeply as she could. But they're still there. The victims. What they looked like.#
EZRI: I know. But then something like this happens. Just the thought of someone like him being here right now.#
EZRI: You're right. Even if it does mean lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling for a few more hours. Goodnight, Julian.#
EZRI: Is this the one we've been looking for?#
EZRI: Why? Why did you do it?#
EZRI: But you're dead.#
EZRI: What?#
EZRI: Dax to Security. Odo? Kira? Anyone there? Security, please answer me. Joran!#
EZRI: What do you want?#
EZRI: Joran.#
EZRI: I'm nothing like you.#
EZRI: I don't want your help.#
EZRI: You murdered three people. I don't want anything to do with you. Now me leave me alone!#
EZRI: No!#
EZRI: What is it, Ben?#
EZRI: It wasn't my favourite subject.#
EZRI: I'll do my best.#
EZRI: What do you think?#
EZRI: But what does it have to do with us?#
EZRI: For what?#
EZRI: How's this?#
EZRI: Better than that melon.#
EZRI: You fired through the wall?#
EZRI: Whoever he is, he's smart.#
EZRI: Nothing. No connection.#
EZRI: Who's there? Who is it? Quark? Is that you?#
EZRI: This isn't funny.#
EZRI: Worf!#
EZRI: Were you following me?#
EZRI: You were worried about me?#
EZRI: You were worried about me. Thank you, Worf. That's sweet.#
EZRI: Of course. I didn't mean to imply otherwise.#
EZRI: Perfectly.#
EZRI: Slowly.#
EZRI: I appreciate it, but you can't, really. Nobody can. Actually, that's not true. There is someone who could help, but I don't want to ask him,#
EZRI: It's complicated.#
EZRI: It wouldn't be pleasant.#
EZRI: And how do you know that?#
EZRI: I'nora, ja'kala vok 'za Ezri. Zhian'tara rek pora'al Zheem Dax tanas rhem Joran. 'za Ezri tanas rhem Joran. Come on, Joran. Don't make me beg. Joran tanas rhem. Vok Ezri, Joran tanas rhem.#
EZRI: The murderer.#
EZRI: It seems so strange separating you from the others, seeing you standing there.#
EZRI: They buried your memories as deep within them as possible.#
EZRI: We'll see about that. Now, let's get to work. We have a killer to catch.#
EZRI: I want to know how he thinks.#
EZRI: We already know how he modified the TR one one six.#
EZRI: If you say so.#
EZRI: Why?#
EZRI: I'm holding the gun.#
EZRI: I've held a rifle before.#
EZRI: I'm moving through different levels of the docking ring.#
EZRI: I'm there. In one of the corridors.#
EZRI: I see a Bajoran Deputy.#
EZRI: No one's here.#
EZRI: A male Starfleet officer. An engineer, about thirty five.#
EZRI: Powerful. In control#
EZRI: I'm not angry or excited.#
EZRI: Detached.#
EZRI: Maybe. But why kill like this? Why not choose a victim on the Promenade or in Quark's?#
EZRI: No!#
EZRI: Then why did you tell me to pull the trigger?#
EZRI: I'm not a murderer. I'm not you.#
EZRI: That has nothing to do with me. You're the killer.#
EZRI: I'm just thinking out loud.#
EZRI: I have a better idea. Let's get back to work. The sooner we find our killer, the sooner you and I can part company.#
EZRI: Think again.#
EZRI: What are we looking for?#
EZRI: We don't even know if the killer ever set foot in here.#
EZRI: I don't know.#
EZRI: Odo checked with Starfleet Command. The one on the left was killed in combat five weeks ago. The one in the middle is stationed on the USS Truman. The Truman hasn't come anywhere near Deep Space Nine in months.#
EZRI: She was here a long time. This was home.#
EZRI: Vanderweg's husband is a micropaleontologist on Mora Five. She was married, Ilario was single. She was on Deep Space Nine for three years, he just got here. She was a mature woman, he was practically a kid. Besides the uniform, they had absolutely nothing in common. Which means they could have just been chosen at random. And if that's the case, then we're wasting our time.#
EZRI: I didn't say that.#
EZRI: I'm sorry to disappoint you.#
EZRI: Me?#
EZRI: You want to turn me into a killer, make me like you.#
EZRI: You want me to kill someone? What do you say I start with you.#
EZRI: They've found him!#
EZRI: I was trying to stop him from getting away, all right? He hit me, I reacted. I guess I overreacted.#
EZRI: I'm sorry things get out of hand, but Bertram killed two people.#
EZRI: Then why was the Security team chasing him?#
EZRI: Why would he replicate a rifle unless he was going to use it?#
EZRI: That doesn't rule him out as a suspect.#
EZRI: Ben, please don't give up on me. I can find this murderer. I know I can. I just need more time.#
EZRI: What did I do?#
EZRI: You're kidding. One word about you and he'd have pulled me off the case.#
EZRI: What does it look like? I'nora, ja'kala vok.#
EZRI: Zheem Dax nah sass eye ahn#
EZRI: D'za oo bah zheest.#
EZRI: Joran rhee jehr hey dah. Joran rhee jehr hey dah.#
EZRI: I'm on my way.#
EZRI: I knew him. Or at least Jadzia did. He has a wife and co-husband on Bolarus.#
EZRI: What did you say?#
EZRI: That's it. It's the pictures! He's laughing!#
EZRI: She's laughing.#
EZRI: That's what the victims have in common. Pictures of laughing faces.#
EZRI: A Vulcan.#
EZRI: This one does. Something happened to him, something so emotionally painful it's making him lose control. When he looks through the targeting sensor and sees those pictures, the laughter seems to mock him.#
EZRI: Computer. How many Vulcan Starfleet Officers are on the station?#
EZRI: I should tell Odo.#
EZRI: Then let's get some.#
EZRI: We still have twenty eight suspects. Vulcans who have suffered a personal loss of some kind.#
EZRI: Not by enough.#
EZRI: There's one thing I don't understand. If he hates laughter, then why doesn't he seek out his victims in Quark's or in a holosuite?#
EZRI: You're right. Maybe it has something to do with the way the photograph freezes the emotion, making it seem like the laughter is going to last forever.#
EZRI: Level twelve, central core.#
EZRI: We go back over our list of suspects, see if we can't narrow it down. Then proof or no proof, we give the list to Odo.#
EZRI: What are you doing?#
EZRI: Sorry. Never mind.#
EZRI: By the way, I'm Counsellor Dax.#
EZRI: We need proof. Something I can take to Odo.#
EZRI: Science Officer Chu'lak. Age ninety seven. Assigned to Deep Space Nine three months ago. Before that, he served aboard the USS Grissom.#
EZRI: The Grissom was destroyed by the Jem'Hadar in the battle of Ricktor Prime. He was one of only six crewmen to survive.#
EZRI: He served on that ship for ten years. Those people who were killed were his colleagues, his friends.#
EZRI: That doesn't make him a killer.#
EZRI: Computer. Locate Science Officer Chu'lak.#
EZRI: Computer. Where are Chu'lak's quarters?#
EZRI: He's studying something on his computer console.#
EZRI: Me. My service record.#
EZRI: He's going into the next room.#
EZRI: He's back. He's carrying something.#
EZRI: Yes.#
EZRI: Tell me. Why did you do it?#
EZRI: Dax to Infirmary. I need an Emergency Medical team. Habitat ring D twelve.#
EZRI: Try not to look so disappointed.#
EZRI: Chzui vok Ezri sheyhal bashar. I'nora ja'kala vok.#
EZRI: Zheem Dax nah sass eye ahn. D'za oo bah zheest. Joran rhee jehr hey dah#

EZRI: I'll have to be careful. Tu Dax noh zhian 'vok j'zui.#
EZRI: Joran rhem tanas Ezri.#
EZRI: Ezri.#
EZRI: I've always wondered how it would feel to be able to fly through space like that.#
EZRI: Guess so.#
EZRI: You've seen through our evil plan.#
EZRI: Whoa! Easy, Julian! What's going on?#
EZRI: But Zeemo does.#
EZRI: Are you talking about robbing the casino?#
EZRI: And anything else that comes along.#
EZRI: Okay.#
EZRI: Nice to meet you.#
EZRI: I'm a very good waitress.#
EZRI: No, but I could go the kitchen and get you one.#
EZRI: Really? That's wonderful.#
EZRI: There's always Quark.#
EZRI: There's one little problem. We're still one man short.#
EZRI: It's all pretty simple really.#
EZRI: Zeemo's due in two days.#
EZRI: Two minutes, fourteen seconds.#
EZRI: Right.#
EZRI: Right away, sir.#
EZRI: Oh, I'm so sorry.#
EZRI: You're not Howard.#
EZRI: Oh. This drink must be yours, then.#
EZRI: But#
EZRI: Sorry. You mind if I drink that? I've been on my feet for hours and I could really use a little pick me up.#
EZRI: Cheers.#
EZRI: I bumped into Captain Boday the other night.#
EZRI: The Gallamites are supplying duranium for the war effort.#
EZRI: Not at first.#
EZRI: You could say that.#
EZRI: And charming.#
EZRI: Worf was commanding the Koraga.#
EZRI: I talked to Benjamin this morning. He said that according to the Koraga's crew, Worf was the last one to leave the bridge. No one knows if he made it to the escape pod.#
EZRI: They've been searching for three days.#
EZRI: I should have gone with them.#
EZRI: Probably nothing, but it would be easier than just sitting here waiting.#
EZRI: You really think so?#
EZRI: And?#
EZRI: He doesn't even like you.#
EZRI: Thanks, Quark.#
EZRI: Go ahead.#
EZRI: Patch it through. What is it, Benjamin?#
EZRI: You're giving up?#
EZRI: But what if he's out there somewhere?#
EZRI: Computer, override locking mechanism.#
EZRI: Authorisation Dax nine seven four alpha three.#
EZRI: I swear.#
EZRI: I'm not spacesick, I'm not spacesick, I'm not.#
EZRI: Uh oh.#
EZRI: Ganda here. Tshh. I'm not reading you very well. There's tshh interference.#
EZRI: What was that, Benjamin?#
EZRI: Don't worry, sir. I'll find him.#
EZRI: Computer, show me the position of the Koraga at the time it was attacked.#
EZRI: Which escape pods were recovered?#
EZRI: Why none from the port side?#
EZRI: Assuming someone made it to the port escape pod closest to the bridge, calculate its trajectory. Computer, take us to the coordinates where it would have entered the Badlands.#
EZRI: Computer, cut all engines.#
EZRI: I know. But with any luck, the currents will take us to the same place they took Worf. Cut the engines.#
EZRI: You're not kidding.#
EZRI: No, let's sit tight. Our only hope of finding that escape pod is to follow the currents. Transfer all available power to the shields.#
EZRI: Computer, hold position. Activate a tractor beam and lock onto that pod.#
EZRI: Worf.#
EZRI: You're hurt.#
EZRI: The Defiant was forced to call off its search because of the Jem'Hadar.#
EZRI: He didn't. I came without his permission. You're a fellow officer. I would've done the same for Kira or Julian.#
EZRI: I'll contact the station and tell them we're on our way back.#
EZRI: What are you doing?#
EZRI: But didn't you just do that a few hours ago?#
EZRI: Right. So, what was it like being in that escape pod for so long?#
EZRI: What'd you do to spend the time?#
EZRI: Nothing? I bet the acoustics in there were pretty good. What'd you sing? Klingon opera?#
EZRI: Which one? Shevok'tah gish?#
EZRI: Ambitious. The solos are for a tenor.#
EZRI: I remember the first night that you played that for Jadzia. I'm sorry.#
EZRI: I understand. What about Alexander?#
EZRI: Is it all right if I ask about the son of Worf? I hear he's been made Weapons Officer of the Ya'Vang.#
EZRI: You make it sound like he didn't deserve it.#
EZRI: Are you ever going to ease up on him?#
EZRI: That's funny, because on our wedding night you told me that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned our wedding night. I mean, Jadzia's wedding night. This is ridiculous. We can't have a conversation if you refuse to talk about the things that we have in common.#
EZRI: You have been avoiding me for the past six months now.#
EZRI: I would have left, but you told me to stay!#
EZRI: If it wasn't for me, you'd still be drifting around in an escape pod singing Klingon opera.#
EZRI: They're Jem'Hadar fighters.#
EZRI: Is that a good idea?#
EZRI: They're coming in behind us.#
EZRI: Shields are down to thirty percent.#
EZRI: Glad to hear it, but that last hit took out our starboard thrusters.#
EZRI: I can't compensate.#
EZRI: That was a good call.#
EZRI: Right. Where's the comm. unit? You didn't take one?#
EZRI: No.#
EZRI: Thanks for spelling it out for me. Look on the bright side. We'll have plenty of time to talk.#
EZRI: Why'd you have to kill a defenceless animal. We have plenty of field rations.#
EZRI: So you traipsed off into the jungle and phasered yourself something to eat.#
EZRI: Oh, well that makes it all the more sporting.#
EZRI: Oh, spare me the one with nature speech.#
EZRI: Fine.#
EZRI: Oh, I thought we weren't supposed to talk about her.#
EZRI: Not enough to get a message back to the station. I'll bet Jadzia would've been able to do it. I was merely making an observation.#
EZRI: You're right. Let's just go about our business and exchange as few words as possible. What is it about men? They either don't talk at all, like you, or they talk too much, like Boday.#
EZRI: We had dinner on the station before I left.#
EZRI: He's interesting. And he's got a good sense of humour.#
EZRI: I don't have to answer that question.#
EZRI: Worf, she didn't even know you back then.#
EZRI: My excuses? I'm not the one who slept with him.#
EZRI: Who are you angry with? Me or Jadzia?#
EZRI: You know what? You're crazy.#
EZRI: Don't turn your back. Talk to me, you coward.#
EZRI: I can't believe I'm stuck here with you.#
EZRI: Where are we?#
EZRI: What were they doing on Goralis? That's a long way from Breen space. Ow.#
EZRI: Actually, I think it happened last night.#
EZRI: Why do you say that?#
EZRI: I bet you've broken a few Klingon rules in your time.#
EZRI: What's that?#
EZRI: Worf was commanding the Koraga.#
EZRI: They're coming in behind us.#
EZRI: I can't believe I'm stuck here with you.#
EZRI: Worf, face it. The 'guard, my cellmate is ill' trick didn't work. Neither did your 'I'll make a tool and short circuit the door' idea.#
EZRI: What's the special today?  Algae paste. My favourite.#
EZRI: I wonder what the Breen look like under those helmets?#
EZRI: Maybe they're all furry. It's supposed to be very cold on Breen.#
EZRI: They're horrible cooks?#
EZRI: Well, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that they saw our shuttle crash and decided to take us back to Deep Space Nine.#
EZRI: Not very, I guess.#
EZRI: You didn't laugh very much at her jokes, either.#
EZRI: In some ways.#
EZRI:  No! No, no. No!#
EZRI: No!#
EZRI: Where are we?#
EZRI: They were chasing me in an ice cave. I was so cold I could barely breathe.#
EZRI: I couldn't get away from them. Every time I looked back they were right behind me. And then one of them grabbed me with this huge claw.#
EZRI: How do you know? Besides, it was a dream. Dreams are full of things that don't make sense.#
EZRI: How can you say that? Dreams contain valuable insights. Things that don't seem to make sense are actually the key to what your unconscious is trying to tell you. Anyway, I got away from him, but there was nowhere to run. And just when I thought he was about to kill me, he reached up and took off his helmet.#
EZRI: And it was Julian.#
EZRI: Isn't that strange? I wonder what it meant?#
EZRI: Very funny. The cave could symbolise the womb. Maybe my subconscious is trying to tell me that I need to confront emotions that I've repressed since birth. But which one? I've been born nine times.#
EZRI: I'm a counsellor. Analysing dreams is part of my job.#
EZRI: Well, I'm not Jadzia, am I?#
EZRI: Where are you taking him?#
EZRI: Worf.#
EZRI: What have they done to you?#
EZRI: Worf, wake up. Please.#
EZRI: Where did they take you?#
EZRI: I wonder what they were trying to find out?#
EZRI: That's probably a good thing.#
EZRI: Careful.#
EZRI: Worf, sit down please. Have something to eat.#
EZRI: Stop it.#
EZRI: What are you going to do? Kill yourself and leave me here alone?#
EZRI: It's no time for Klingon chest-thumping either.#
EZRI: Stop it!#
EZRI: I'm going to help you through this, Garak. I'm not just saying this because I'm your sister. You have a gift. No more algae paste. I'm not like you. I'm not like you, Joran, I'm not a murderer.#
EZRI: I was your wife. Why don't you talk to me? I love you. Kiss me. Kiss me, Julian.#
EZRI: Would you stop that? What's wrong? You haven't said a word to me in hours.#
EZRI: What is that supposed to mean?#
EZRI: I must've missed something when I was gone.#
EZRI: For who?#
EZRI: What?#
EZRI: I did?#
EZRI: Julian? I said I loved with Julian?#
EZRI: Worf, look, I admit that I find him to be charming. And obviously he is an attractive man. But I'm not#
EZRI: I am not!#
EZRI: You're the one that said dreams don't mean anything.#
EZRI: Would you stop comparing me to her!#
EZRI: Stop it!#
EZRI: I hate to say it, but this is doing wonders for my back.#
EZRI: Probably not.#
EZRI: You're right. There's just a few problems. We're on a Jem'Hadar ship heading in the wrong direction, hanging upside down and#
EZRI: I think I'm getting spacesick.#
EZRI: Let me try.#
EZRI: And your fingers are too fat.#
EZRI: Would you just#
EZRI: Ow.#
EZRI: Ow!#
EZRI: Yes, I'm hurt. You just cut my finger and made me hit my head!#
EZRI: I still don't see how getting a pin out of a bunk is going to help us escape.#
EZRI: No, thank you. The last time you touched me, things got a little out of control.#
EZRI: Seduced? I seduced you?#
EZRI: What?#
EZRI: You have the biggest ego of any man I've ever known.#
EZRI: Am I supposed to be embarrassed because Jadzia had a few lovers before you?#
EZRI: You're right. It was more than a few. It was dozens. Hundreds. In fact, I don't think there was anyone aboard DS Nine who wasn't her lover!#
EZRI: You can't be serious.#
EZRI: War criminals? What are the charges?#
EZRI: If you want to end the war why don't you convince the Founders to surrender?#
EZRI: Ready.#
EZRI: Oh, shut up.#
EZRI: Look who's talking.#
EZRI: The Dax symbiont has lived for over three hundred years. Experienced eight lifetimes. And now it's all going to end with an execution on Cardassia. Ezri Tigan's contribution to the Dax legacy will be to end it.#
EZRI: You know, Worf, I have had just about enough of your little Klingon aphorisms. The only reason I came on this mission was to save your miserable life, so the least you could do is stop acting like such a self righteous targ.#
EZRI: Do you really think that I would disobey orders and risk my life so I could seduce you? I hate to burst your bubble, Worf, but it wasn't that good.#
EZRI: There was a time when you found my sense of humour to be one of my more endearing qualities.#
EZRI: Are you angry at me for something that I did or because I'm not Jadzia? Let's cut right to the heart of the matter. Do you love me? Me? Ezri?#
EZRI: Answer the question. Do you love me?#
EZRI: What is it, Worf? Could it be that you're feeling just a little guilty because you don't have the same feelings for me that you did for Jadzia? If that's true, maybe we both made a mistake back on Goralis. So maybe we both should be forgiven.#
EZRI: What?#
EZRI: There's no crime in that.#
EZRI: Go on. From the first moment you came on the station, I knew you were not Jadzia, and yet I knew that there was a part of Jadzia still alive within you. On Goralis, I allowed myself to see her instead of you.#
EZRI: I felt the same way. A part of me, the part that was your wife, wanted very much to be close to you.#
EZRI: Worf, we're not gods or prophets. We're people. We make mistakes. There is one other thing I want you to know. I honestly didn't realise how I felt about Julian. I would have never hidden something like that from you.#
EZRI: That's good to know. Friends?#
EZRI: And more.#
EZRI: Sounds like a lazy day to me.#
EZRI: Why are you doing this?#
EZRI: I vote for option one.#
EZRI: You see, I told you they'd miss us. So, who won the betting pool?#
EZRI: I know what you're going to say, and the answer is yes, I did leave the station without your permission, and yes, I lost a runabout, but#
EZRI: Weyoun and the others were more interested in asking questions than they were answering them.#
EZRI: I'm not sure, but I can tell you one thing. He hates Weyoun.#
EZRI: I think Damar is worried that this new alliance with the Breen is going to weaken Cardassia's status with the Dominion even more. But whatever his reasons, we owe him our lives.#
EZRI: Miles does have a certain cherubic quality.#
EZRI: I'm not certain about anything. But he is handsome.#
EZRI: He knows how to have a good time. Besides, it's not exactly a toy. You heard the Chief. He spent hours making that.#
EZRI: I know. Maybe I am in love with him. Do you think I should tell him how I feel?#
EZRI: You're a good friend, Worf.#
EZRI: You know, if you want to go down there and help them.  Just a thought.#
EZRI: Autonomous guidance system initialised and active.;#
EZRI: It's a model.#
EZRI: The comm's out.#
EZRI: We're venting plasma coolant from over eight separate EPS ruptures. The air's becoming toxic, Captain.#
EZRI: Hi.#
EZRI: You wanted to see me?#
EZRI: You said something about my test results?#
EZRI: Our conversation?#
EZRI: Well, I guess now is as good a time as any. Well, it goes back to when Worf and I were held prisoner by the Breen. We spent a lot of time together.#
EZRI: And you can imagine that it would bring up all sorts of old feelings.#
EZRI: And, well, one thing led to another, and#
EZRI: But I want to.#
EZRI: Who?#
EZRI: No, Julian, that's not#
EZRI: No, you don't understand. What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm in love with#
EZRI: What? Julian, what's wrong?#
EZRI: So what are you going to do?#
EZRI: Look, I'm just not sure that I should be giving you advice on what to do in this situation. It's a Klingon matter.#
EZRI: This is the first that I've heard of it.#
EZRI: That's very sweet of him.#
EZRI: Not a very Klingon word, is it?#
EZRI: It's very honourable.#
EZRI: Okay. But I'm not sure you're going to like it.#
EZRI: I think that the situation with Gowron is a symptom of a bigger problem. The Klingon Empire is dying. And I think it deserves to die.#
EZRI: Don't get me wrong, I'm very touched that you still consider me to be a member of the House of Martok, but I tend to look at the Empire with a little more scepticism than Curzon or Jadzia did. I see a society that is in deep denial about itself. We're talking about a warrior culture that prides itself on maintaining centuries old traditions of honour and integrity, but in reality it's willing to accept corruption at the highest levels.#
EZRI: Am I? Who was the last leader of the High Council that you respected? Has there even been one? And how many times have you had to cover up the crimes of Klingon leaders because you were told it was for the good of the Empire? I know this sounds harsh, but the truth is, you have been willing to accept a government that you know is corrupt. Gowron's just the latest example. Worf, you are the most honourable and decent man I've ever met, and if you're willing to tolerate men like Gowron, then what hope is there for the Empire?#
EZRI: I have no idea. The Chief was supposed to come fix my sonic shower this morning, but he never showed up. I asked the computer where he was, and when I came in, this is what I found. Have any idea who this is?#
EZRI: Then I'd guess this isn't some kind of obscure meditation therapy.#
EZRI: Julian, are you with us?#
EZRI: So, how's Odo?#
EZRI: Oh, that's great.#
EZRI: That's, that's really great.#
EZRI: I didn't know we were getting another Defiant class ship.#
EZRI: Well, I'll let you two get acquainted.#
EZRI: Whoa!#
EZRI: I'm sorry.#
EZRI: Hi.#
EZRI: It's that time.#
EZRI: I know.#
EZRI: I have a confession. You go first.#
EZRI: No, really, Julian. You go first.#
EZRI: Something more?#
EZRI: I've been wondering the same thing.#
EZRI: Me too.#
EZRI: I've been trying to tell you, but every time I just couldn't get the words out.#
EZRI: Neither do I. You know why we might be holding back? The friendship.#
EZRI: I've made that mistake before.#
EZRI: You can never go back.#
EZRI: I can't bear the thought of losing you as a friend.#
EZRI: We've figured it out. You know, it takes a certain maturity to not be swept away by the romantic fantasy.#
EZRI: Chemistry isn't everything.#
EZRI: I think we should be proud of ourselves.#
EZRI: Friends.#
EZRI: Good morning.#
EZRI: What are you smiling at?#
EZRI: Not a chance. I'd have turned and walked the other way as soon as I saw you.#
EZRI: Me too.#
EZRI: Julian.#
EZRI: We have to get up.#
EZRI: It's a big day.#
EZRI: Such as?#
EZRI: I suppose you'll want to tell Miles.#
EZRI: Because you tell him everything.#
EZRI: Good. Oh, we really should get up. We don't want the Defiant leaving without us.#
EZRI: There's a first time for everything.#
EZRI: Let's make a pact. We both come home alive.#
EZRI: I'm holding you to that.#
EZRI: You're sure you're not angry?#
EZRI: Well, now that he knows how I feel.#
EZRI: That's a relief.#
EZRI: You're kidding, right?#
EZRI: Sir, Chancellor Martok would like to speak to you and Admiral Ross.#
EZRI: Captain, Admiral Ross for you.#
EZRI: Aye, sir.#
EZRI: Aye, sir.#
EZRI: Sir, most of our fighters are either destroyed or under attack themselves.#
EZRI: They've switched sides.#
EZRI: Sir, Admiral Ross and Chancellor Martok would like to talk to you.#
EZRI: All things considered, I think I'd rather be on Risa.#
EZRI: You're coming to Vic's tonight, right?#
EZRI: Who's asking?#
EZRI: You helped him become Chancellor. You can't very well turn your back on him now.#
EZRI: Congratulations, Worf.#
EZRI: Jadzia loved Rio.#
EZRI: We found the Captain's runabout orbiting Bajor.#
EZRI: Better keep it coming.#
EZRI: I think that after dinner tonight, we should go to Quark's, spend some time in a holosuite.#
EZRI: Actually, I was thinking about the Alamo.#
EZRI: Why not?#
EZRI: What happens then?#
EZRI: Until they're wiped out.#
EZRI: Lucky guess. I take it we'll be the Spartans?#
EZRI: Just like the Alamo.#
EZRI: Have you talked to a counsellor about these annihilation fantasies?#
EZRI: I'll set up a session for you tomorrow.#
EZRI: Tonight we defend the pass.#
